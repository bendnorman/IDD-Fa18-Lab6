22,the worst is when a family or group of people will get to the end of a hall or doorway  and decide that s a perfect place to stop and hang out  seriously people  imagine people are liquid  if you re a cork in the bottle  you re doing it wrong 
23,went to see deadpool opening night  2nd showing arrived about 15 mins before start time  which is later than i usually would like to show up  and the ticket line is pretty long no worries  i had already purchase reserved seats five minutes later we get to the front and pick up our tickets and move on to the concession stand three lines  and we go to the shortest guy at the register walks away  i assume he s grabbing a customer s food or what not a few minutes pass  and the guys not back 7 minutes later he walks back and puts a  closed  sign in front of his register 
24,or you call the automated phoneline so you can pay a bill  and they say that they ca nt service you because it s after hours

26,what tip percentage do you typically expect for delivery  genuinely curious as someone who rarely orders delivery  and would think that 15  is an adequate amount

37,they both sound like decent hardworking people  though  how much are the glasses she needs  did they just spend 10 grand in other stuff she  needed  before this came up  i heard she had a boyfriend now can he help out  seeing as they are practically engaged  do they blow a lot of money at the casino  or is it like a  100 occasional night out for them  it is nice to get presents from your husband  especially for a big anniversary or other special occasion does the daughter have any jewellery that was given to her by her boyfriend  i m sort of playing devil s advocate here  but maybe they are heartless  selfish parents  and maybe they are nt you may know  but we do nt

40,it s not a big deal she s actually pretty lucky many men have an aversion to tasting themselves my take  how can you expect someone to gobble you down  if you do nt know how it tastes  
41,not so much the taste  for me  as shooting it directly on my gag reflex and the smell i do nt really taste it  but goddamnit if it hits the back of my throat  and i smell it i m gon na puke sucks really  cuz the idea of it turns me on so much and also what ueatinchicken said about it coating everything it just does nt dissipate like it should  edit  formatting  sorry on my phone

72,question  is the nsfw necessary for language  such as the  f  word  
73,this does nt say anything about the puffin  we re free

94,who irons anymore 
95,pro tip for office working bachelors  if you want to look sharp and successful  always iron and starch your work clothes  even if they re not wrinkled there s a noticeable difference between a wrinkle free shirt and a well ironed shirt there s nothing wrong with the former  but the latter projects a better image  also  pay extra attention to the cuffs and collar both should be nicely starched  always from the inside rather than the outside to avoid flaking or shine  and just a little bit stiff 
96,well  no one really sees my underwear  since i also wear pants from time to time   so no one out and about in public or wherever will care if i have nt changed them in a few days

111,well that is really convenient until he finds out someone already used the paper
112,that s me i only do it after regularly discovering my print job stalled because somebody else ran the printer dry and never noticed  because they forgot they sent it in the first place  if i get to the printer and there is anything else there besides my job  i throw it out into the locked shred bin unless  of course  it has personal information like social security numbers  health insurance data  or salary information  in which case it goes into my pearl harbor file

249,reminds me of a friend of mine who invited a handful of people over for the superbowl and her puppy ran off to her bedroom and returned with her anal beads  which were in a box under her bed   she said she had 2 choices in that moment  1 deny deny deny and claim she had no idea  must ve been from an old roommate  despite living alone for about 10 months at that time    2 claim they were hers  own up to it and take them away  she chose 2 said something about  yeah  this is embarrassing   then she said the party got funny it was guys looking at their girls  see it s awesome   girls saying  eww  before another girl said  yeah i like that   and turning the tide of the conversation  i d like to think that little pit bull puppy brought some new and amazing things into a few couples sex lives that day  which is a horrible standalone statementso do nt quote me out of context you jerks  lol 
250,college textbook prices are such a racket pirated copies are a public service 
251,i had a book that i needed for a class the cheapest i could find was  600 used yay pdf s 
252, hey man how about you go the fuck down to your old work place and talk to your coworker face to face about my game   why do nt i go down and talk to this guy myself 
253,why the fuck do people borrow something they are already borrowing  without asking    i ve never understood this  it s a total  fuck you  i do nt respect you or your shit  to the person that actually owns the object 
254,people like her are fucking sad dude 
255,i know that feel bro  
256,she was trying to break it to you gently misguided perhaps  but no matter you re broken up move onward and upward 
257,do nt worry about the reason behind the dumping  just take the dumping at face value no matter how hard it is and move on also  no valentine s shit for someone who just dumped you vd is not a friend holiday 
258,dont worry about losing someone you cared about because she didnt care about you if she did she would still be with you 
259,i have gotten so much out of this over the years  especially when dealing with people that are accustomed to talking to angry people  i hate comcast as much as anyone  but their individual support representatives are nt the problem with the company being nice to them will get you far on separate occasions  i ve received six months of free service and a complete account wipe  meaning i became eligible for new customer promos again   and while no one ever said  you re so nice  i ll do this    i strongly believe that was responsible  i find it also works great for credit reports  too i had a couple old medical charges on my credit report that slipped through the cracks  and after you pay them they re under no responsibility to remove them from the report  they remain there  marked as paid but late  which reduces your credit rating   i called and oozed friendliness  and in both cases they removed them from my credit report again  maybe that was just their policy  but generally i ve found that when i m friendly  people are helpful 
260,ever thought maybe because we are nt polite to customer rep because rep was nt helpful 
261,my experience is they tell me there s nothing to be done and try to end the call as quickly as possible then i get angry and get some results  i try nice first  but nice usually means taking no for an answer 
262,pizza delivery  nice customer on phone  always a free cookie  or garlic pizza bread  or something even out of my way trying for the lowest possible price not very nice customer on phone  no we do nt have it  no that does nt work  no i m not allowed to give you anything for free  gt  you re gon na get more no s than when you tried convincing your gf for anal  bookstore  nice person  polite asking  humble  use every single of my googleinternal database skills in order to help you  even if it is just purple book about alien dude  gt  98  chance of success rude  fullofthemself  arrogant customer  nope to almost everything  you have to be more precise  there are millions of books out there   we have a system malfunction  try to come back another day  or try to look for the book yourself in the meantime   and obviously absolutely no discounts  two winks at the manager in charge in order to let her know that this customer s behaviour does nt deserve anything extra  luckily  i do nt have to deal with customers anymore 
263,does nt always work  but a lot of the time i have seen great success  it goes for any service food prep  waiterwaitress  a stock employee at a chain store  etc  being pleasant also makes me feel good 
264,but you ca nt be a proud  angry  black  woman without yelling to prove they do nt know who they are not to fuck wit and racism and shit oh yeah let me talk to your manager display shit gon na be free 
265,no they fucking wont   ok sir  thank you so much for that sir  etc  all they do is follow a script the people on the phone 99  of the time are just drones that cant actually do anything  this should read   if you want phone support to actually help you  as for the person that has the power to help you  this is not true for smaller companies though 
266,yes and no my buddy was a customer service guy for tivo and he did not give a fuck about that job he would hang up on people daily regardless of how nice they were if he did nt feel like dealing with the issue they had  he would nt he got fired  but still 
267,i work in tech support being kind and polite is only part of it here s a list  if you do all of these things  i will do absolutely 100  everything in my power to give you the best support i can   be on a phone that works no bluetooth  no speaker  and be in a quiet room   have relevant information ready account numbers  part numbers etc  do nt call when driving or going to the bathroom  please   i did nt design or build what you think is broken and 95  of the time you ca nt get it working is because of something you did  so do nt be mad at me   if you want it fixed  do what i say when i say it you re calling me for help  i know how to fix it help me help you   i enjoy a little bit of small talk  but i do nt need to hear your life story i have other people waiting on the line behind you 
268,i ve found this is more true with online customer chat anytime i ve done that  with a few different companies  they end up going out of their way to refund me  fix the trouble  give me extra money  etc and i always thank them and let them know they are amazing 
269,  actual advice mallard   gt   if you are kind and polite to the customer support rep on the phone gt   they will go out of their way to help you
270,people itt are talking about phone reps for major corporations  but this advice applies to any kind of service industry i m a guest service rep  front desk  at a hotel  and i do have the ability to reduce the nightly rate  increase it over our bestavailable rate  or give a compupgrade  up to  150 value sometimes  depending on your attitude over the phone you would nt believe the kinds of shit people say to get a discount on their room just last week   are you going to give me a discount because you re almost full    no  story time  just last night  my room has no view    it looks like you reserved a k size with a partial view   this false advertising  i m looking at a parking lot    sir  if you wanted the view room  you should have reserved the room with a view the partial view has a partial view of the ocean   well i m fucking pissed off now  we re checking out   what s your room number  we ll get you going right away   you figure it out    ok  what s your last name   this is fucking bullshit  blahblahblahblahblahblah   i go to the reservation bucket  with all the hotel guests  names  flipping through them slowly  making direct eyecontact  what s your last name   sonofabitchson   not really his last name   alright  i ve gone ahead and checked you out just so you know  you will be charged for the room due to our 24hr cancellation policy stated during the reservation   says some more bullshit  5minutes later when he has to tell his wife he threw a tantrum  he calls down to my coworker   ok  we ve decided to stay can you tell the guy that i apologize  what a valentines day 
271,this is very true i work in the hospitality industry and me and my co workers were just talking about this if someone calls super irate and yelling at my acting like i personally did something to them on purpose or like it s my fault  i m more than likely going to say   sorry sirmaam i m unable to help you  but i can transfer you to my manager   90 percent of the time i m able to help some what  whether it be a small refund  or a discount or just an explanation to what they want sometimes what they want is just to know that their refund had already been applied but the bank can take a few days to clear things i will take time out to look up an old receipt or email them or whatevr i can if they are nice  when i end up transferring them to a manager  it is hit or miss if they are able going to get back to  or get what they want  whether it s a restaurant or a hotel  i m always nice to the people i know that that it s usually not the persons fault who i am talking to the people behind the counter are nice somewhat because they have to  belt also because they want the respect from the customers 
272,your problem is nt lending games it s needing better friends 
273,since the dawn of time  this has happened this is the time when you learn that  and hopefully do nt make the same mistake again 
274,or you could tell the guy go away 
275,of course he can afford a replacement do you know how much a healthy finger goes for these days 
276,story time  a few years ago i broke up with a gf of  3 years before we broke up she had been playing skyrim on my xbox she texted me some odd weeks after the breakup and asked if she could finish her game of skyrim i told her that the game and its save data were on the xbox  so i could nt do that she   insisted   that i should let her take my xbox  which at the time i was playing on regularly  so that she could finish the game  and threw a temper tantrum about it  i guess the good thing that came out of it was when my friends saw the texts she sent me  they were nt buying her shit she told them about me anymore 
277,he did nt let his colleague borrow it think about it why would he just part with it  that s not his personality greed and dishonesty is a big part of who  scumbag steve  is he has your game still  he just wants you to think it s in someone else s hands he s probably playing it at this very moment 
278,lol its more than likely a pdf version from the company that was purchased then uploaded 
279,did you at least blow him 
280,the unsung heroes of the internet who ul all our movies  music  and textbooks will never be celebrated  but we all admire their courage and public service  what a fucking racket  2015 tax book costs  300  2016 tax book costs  300  same shit just some edits and revisions here and there go back to the bookstore and they pay you  50 for the  old   ie one semester old  book in the back of your minds  they can not get away with this forever all things like this have a breaking point  and the college system is in serious peril once the veil is pierced and we all see the racket that it is  if you have nt already   a toast to the unsung heroes of the internet that selflessly upload for the public good 
281,but then you realized you have to pay a hundred bucks to just submit homework on pearson fuck pearson fuck you pearson 
282,if you are kind to people they will be kind to you  except for the ones that wo nt be kind to you anyway 
283,used to work for a credit card terminal support helpdesk the people that called in and were assholes right off the bat because they need their machine fixed usually caused me to turn off instantly i get that you need your machine up and going  i get that you lose money if its not up  but let me point out something to you  you are calling me for help your issue was caused by your stupidity 34 of the time  and i know how to fix that on the machine  i could have gotten you up and going within 10 minutes of calling in but because you re a jackass to me  we ll go ahead and make it last 30 because that s when my 15 minute break is and i do nt want to deal with more calls right now 
284,i m always nice to customer support people because generally speaking i m not a dick 
285,while this has worked for me  i can say for certain that most of the time it has not 
286,they may be more likely to  but this is nt an absolute 
287,no they wo nt  source  i work at my university s it helpdesk being nice does nt make you any less stupid 
288, he stuck a gun in my face and threatened to shoot me  advice   you should really seek couples counseling i think you can salvage this relationship 
289,sometimes be kind anyway  because why be an asshole  most of them are just wage slaves doing a shitty job 
291,i do nt believe a running club is really a thing op is being silly 
292,you must not live in the sticks  or the south 
293,how do i find the running club
295,this may vary depending on company  policy  and person but while i worked for xbox support call and chat i would do everything and some to make sure you were good if you acted like a decent person once i got a rude  brat or something if i was nt able to get you to calm down and act human i proceeded to not care and gave shitty help and worry about the other customers i had i just do nt want to deal with you  i do nt sympathize with you  i really just do nt care   i love my games and crap but i wo nt take it out on some stranger because it s just a game   like i play games a lot i know the need to be able to play still no reason to be an ass 
296,there needs to be some sort of stipulationbecause they are only going to do what is within their power which is nt a whole lot  i think we all understand that the person on the other end of the phone is nt the cause  but it does nt change the fact that i m the customerclient  i mean if you are paying someone close to minimum wage  how much  power  do they really have  i get it  it does nt matter how high in the food chain you are  unless you are at the top you do nt necessarily have all the power  this is nt a put down of anyone that works in a call center  but if they ca nt solve my problem and continue to escalate my call to their supervisor who also ca nt solve my problemit s frustrating and annoying  my biggest problem is when the person on the other end tells me or implies that something is nt their job you do nt have to tell me this  tell me anything other than this  it just is nt something that flies and it s not something i ve ever told a clientcustomer i ve thought it plenty of times  but it s just unprofessional 
297,generally speaking  i m an asshole that being said  i am profoundly nice to customer service reps whenever i have to call a call center for anything  my primary objective is to get them to have an actual conversation with me the reason i called is secondary  it ll be handled anyway 
298,i know i do go out of my way i mean 
299,they will do everything in their power to help  unless they are under pressure not to  sadly  being nice gets you most of the way  but the squeaky wheel gets the oil  one example  had a screaming customer at my kinkos store  and i could not help him he was belligerent over customs tax that was charged to an international shipment he would nt even let me speak he just wanted me to give him 70ish dollars from my register told him to call 800   he did  then they talked to me i told them that he signed the shipping label  indicating he would accept charges he yelled at the lady and yelled at me continuously  they issued him a full refund of his original charge  and a check for the tax  i quit retail 
301,this is far from always being the case 
303,go take alex out to dinner before she does 
304,op  post the letter put your karma where your mouth is and bite down hard 
305, dodged   https  uncommongeekfileswordpresscom201404thematrixbullettimegifgif 
306,i still do nt believe this happened
307,enjoy having a pair of balls sounds like you ve misplaced them for a while
309,they want that 55 survey rating 
310,clearly you ve never called comcast 
311,speaking as someone who did tech support over the phones in the past  the converse is also true if you are a mean asshole to me before i ve even said anything  i will deliberately do things to fuck with you  like force restart your router  reset your wifi password to the convoluted alphanumeric string that can only be found on the sticker on the bottom of the router  and other annoying things as part of my  fix   sometimes  these things are required for an actual fix  but not always  and if you make my life hell for no good reason  i ll return the favor 
312,not even close to universally true maybe there are some companies that encourage this  or individuals with a chip on their shoulder working in call centers who will do this  but i am never  ever rude on the phone and a vast majority of customer service reps stick to their script and toe the company line until i hang up it is only when i get audibly annoyed and ask for someone s boss that they start to think for themselves and try to actually help me out this advice mallard should just be  be kind and polite to everyone   not because it might inspire someone to actually do their fucking job  but because its the nice thing to do 
313,i have to disagree with this in some cases this may be true  but in the places i ve worked  the general philosophy was that nice and patient people got shoved to the bottom of the priority list while angry douchebags more or less got whatever they were asking for  i wish this was nt the case but i think most managers would rather avoid getting a complaint letter than reward kindness 
314,ive found going off on the first rep works really well they record it in the notes then the second rep will be extra cautious trying to please you did this with comcast  had no choice but to cuss out one of their worker bees to get a manager that fixed the problem  while the worker bee refused to help me saved me  40 a month on bills 
315,i was a csr for years  can confirm csrs i talk to now  as a customer  usually tell me they wish all customers were as polite as i am  when i tell them it s because i worked the job for years  they always thank mefeels good man
316,i can confirm can be applied to people working front desk at hotels
317,i like how in this thread you have angry customers of largely cable companies saying   this is not true fuck you fuck customer service   and then you have people who actually work in customer service largely saying   100  true i will always help the person who is nice to me  maybe your experience with bad cs was because you re calling a shitty company  and you have a bad attitude already  maybe  you know the saying   if you run into an asshole in the morning  he s an asshole if you run into assholes all day  maybe you re the asshole 
318,this is nt true at all it depends on what kind of customer service you need i ve been on lines where i was as nice as i could be and the person is a nasty fuck  other times they would go out of their way to even give me a bunch of free things  talking to you blizzard  when i was somewhat upset over something and needed customer support help 
319,one of my good friends hit me up that her and her boyfriend were having a rough time and all of our other girlfriends were just saying cut it off not knowing the guy i gave her actual advise on what she could maybe do to mend the problem i was the only one to say to try to work it out if he was worth it everyone told her to call it off and they are back to being happy 
320,he lost it or broke it  i guarantee it
321,local running club  what
322,if you live in a smaller townneighborhood  contact the post office mail carriers know all of the dogs on their route and will recognize one that is nt where it belongs 
324,so you told him to shove it and left anyway right 
325,so when they need to surgically remove your foot from his ass  will you be allowed time off work 
326,sorry  but my town is so small we do nt have a running club not even a gun  strip or old mans club 
327,how do you know we re not thinking the op is a dipshit and we re conspiring to do their significant other a favor 
328,you should definitely break up with us then
329,also the best people to ask to find the best beer in town running clubs know how to drink 
330,there s also a running group called the hash house harriers they often run places where your average running club will not there are clubs all over the world many cities have multiple clubs they re a bunch of halfminds  but they would gladly keep an eye out for a missing animal 
331,ummare you sure you two are dating  does she know 
332,if someone takes life changing advice from a random person on the internet then i think they are the idiot 
333,where i live the local hunting club would be a better bet  just not sure you will like the condition of your pet  jk they re actually really upstanding chaps 
334,op  is it me or does it kind of seem like op might have overinflated this relationship in his own mind  just maybe 
335,honestly  i recommend plastering your dog s info all over social media the dog loving community where i live is pretty incredible  they share your posts like wild fire that s how i got my little fur dude back and my neighbor s dog as well 
337,i m glad you found your duck 
338,and where do i find that number 
339,what kind of white suburbia gated community do you live in

342,i live near philadelphia i ve never heard of anyone getting a ticket for jaywalking everybody crosses where they want  when they want  a coworker was sent to san diego for a week when he came back he tried to submit 5 jaywalking tickets in his expense report which were all turned down he got 5 jaywalking tickets in just under a week he said he could nt help it by the time he realized he was crossing illegally he was already halfway across the street and the cops were coming for him 
343,the best part is i m fairly confident you were never dating this girl you may have thought so  but she did nt 
344,i just lost my pet  this is no time for exercise 
345,i run a support department and this is our stated policy if you re nice and patient we will help you as much as we can  up to and including hounding the developers to get them to fix a bug 
347,straight guys keep posting these it makes me glad i m gay   
348,once while running i saw a chicken on the road  i presume it was someone s pethome egg layer on one side of the road was houses and the other was the river  i ran that route pretty often and never saw the chicken again i hope it fulfilled it s life s purpose 
349,i m in the same situation broke up with my boyfriend the day after valentine s day too we were together for almost a year and i paid for everything i went out of my way for the guy and i planned an amazing valentine s day scavenger hunt  plus i bought dinner  paid for the cab  got him a wallet he has been asking for and i also arranged for a pizza to be delivered with one of the scavenger hunt clues written on the inside of the box he made me a card while he was on break at work and i feel like i m being too materialistic  that s what he is telling me anyway   i just want to be with someone who will give me their all like i d give them my all  is that too much 
350,kanye west will try his kanye best to get out of this kanye mess

356,how is the first part socially awesome 
357,i advise everyone to break up with their boyfriend or girlfriend who cares  do it just for a laugh go find another one what does it matter 
358,national grid does this too i stayed on hold with them for almost an hour before they came on and said their call center was closed  fuck national grid 
360,so not true i am nice to them and usually get nothing however i know people who chew them out and get whatever they want 
361,the quick answer is to stop watching tv 
362,didnt he then tweet that he s personally rich and that any rich person knows not to spend their money  but instead spend some other rich persons money 
363,debt isnt the same as net worth  you can have millions of dollars and still have millions in debt 
364,lady gaga was like  5 million in the hole 4 years ago and now she is positive around  200 million do nt underestimate the cash flow of someone in a position like kanye 
365,is making his new album tidal exclusive and forcing people to torrent it really the best strategy for repaying that 53 million dollar debt 
366,kanye wishes he had your support  many things about him have been exaggerated 
367,you spent the  200 on gifts  did you forget to give them to her 
369, 510 for sweatpants 
370,i think all of this is just a pr trick
371,you should know rich people do nt go bankrupt like the rest of us 
372,as a closing in on 40 year old  something i have learned  never lend out anything you ca nt afford to give away  this includes money 
373,i m pretty sure it s his business that s  53m in the hole that s not the same as being in personal debt 
374,kanye is crazy  but his music is fantastic

392,make sure to up your homeowners policy because you may need extra insurance if the dog actually attacks someone generally it s only a matter of time as domesticated dogs do nt normally see humans as threats and this is what makes them poor  guard  dogs as they are all bark and no bite

394,as a former customer service rep i would say that your odds only slightly increase

398,women s bathrooms are  bloody  dirty 
399,can confirm  source  janitor for two years 
400,when my wife was living by herself in college and i came over there was always a giant pile of trash in the corner of her dorm room because  it was gross  to take the trash out 
401,i ve heard it argued that women s bathrooms are dirtier  precisely  because women themselves are cleaner i ve heard it explained  by women  that women do nt want to touch or clean up the dirtiness of a bathroom  so they just leave it men  on the other hand  will grab a wad of toilet paper off the floor and toss it because who cares if it s dirty  i have no idea how true that is  but it s the explanation i ve heard 
402,i cleaned mcdonalds bathrooms  both public amp  private employee  for 2 years the women s bathroom would have the most insane shit happen in it and yes i realize women go to the bathroom more frequently than men  and if you sit in any fast food place for 30 minutes you will see a constant stream of women enter the restaurant  use the bathroom  and then leave smaller bladders  shorter urethra s  vaginal issues  i get it i get it this is nt about that  because that shit s biology at work  nothing they can do about it  this is about   a large steaming pile of shit and toilet paper that clogged amp  overflowed the toilet in the   female s private crew bathroom    so it was a fucking employee  an employee that had to be between the ages of 1522  or so because that was all who was working that night   maxipads everywhere other than the special bins they were supposed to be in my opinion on women is  this is the physical evidence speaking  not me  they take their bloody pads and just drop them on the ground  fuck reaching over 15 inches  opening the lid on this bin specifically for female hygienic products and depositing it in there  i m just going to throw it behind the toilet   every day i had to deal with this   toilet paper all over the floor  everywhere  all of the time wtf  there were   two   garbage cans in this small bathroom  2 stalls  2 sinks     things     on the mirrors    smudges  i have no idea the mirrors were always super fucked up and took massive amounts of windex to clean   weird stains on the walls as if someone just took a bottle of liquid and said  hey lets create some art on the wall yeeaaahhh buddy    broken fingernails  probably fakes  on the floor   bobbypins or whatever the fuck so many i should have kept them all and melted them down and sold them to a metallics recycler for  1000000000   shitty toilet paper on the toilet seats  on the floor  and a few times on the sink area wtf 
403,i worked at a restaurant for 5 years if homeless men lived in the men s room it would have been cleaner than the woman s room  pretty sure the bathroom scene from not another teen movie happened in there on a daily basis
406,you make me sick  
407,for months  i watched a facebook friend post jokes he stole from professional comedians on twitter he got so many likes i slowly developed a hatred for him he never told anyone the jokes were from twitter and it was a few years ago  before a lot of people in middle america were using the site made me so mad one day  i d had enough started commenting on his posts  oh yeah  i saw this on twitter  too i guess we both follow rob delaney  or whoever it was    he stopped a little while after that

424,i reddit yesterday
425,as a woman  i would agree i m deployed right now and these women are fucking gross there are empty toilet paper rolls all over  all the time that s when they actually decide to replace the empty rollthat is the showers always have gross wads of hair we actually have to have signs that tell them not to flush their fucking tampons down the toilet gt  _lt 
427,i spent 20 years living with 3 brothers and 10 months living with women in basic military training and tech school  never again will i live among ladies  so help me  god   with boys you have the occasional pee dribble on the toilet bowl or scum in the sink but those women were savages as  latrine queen  i witnessed globs of shaving and waxing products  wads of hair smeared on shower walls or crammed down the drain  tumbleweeds of hair rolling down the halls  bobby pins and rubber bands in every crevice  and on weekends enough glitter to gag a hooker do nt get me started on what happened with the monthly stuff it was a surreal and eye opening experience i m by no means perfect and my husband s sink is far better than mine but i know first hand that women are far messier than men 
428,do nt forget the massive amounts of toilet paper they use i swear  i put in new rolls of tp in the woman s bathroom 10x more than in the men s i understand that you women need to wipe everytime you do anything  but you do nt need to sacrifice a quarter of the roll to do it

470,i drink a lot at least four to five days a week some times i did nt drink for about a week and a half last week and i did nt have any serious withdrawals that i noticed for the hallucinations would i be able to tell im hallucinating  and i ve felt a little shaky some times are those tremors  i usually only drink around 6 to 10 shots some times less and generally eat at some point does that lessen my chances of my body being dependent enough to cause this 
471,shit i stopped drinking 5 weeks ago i would have died by now though  right 
472,it s very true i knew two guys who were alkie bar flies they quit for a new years resolution or something and died from shock liver  kidney  something else failure  same year and everything

477,a couple times i ve ended up with a top comment in a post  and had 20 people reply with the same joke i guess plenty of people do nt have thumbs 
478,  practice courtesy upvoting   courtesy upvoting is when you upvote someone who replies to your comment or post it just makes sense to me to show my appreciation for their time replying and reading my post it just feels appropriate 
479,you spelled downvote  wrong
480,nah that s when you look at other comments  take best parts from them as well and rephrase to sound it better enjoy karma 
481,but you ca nt use an upvote bigger than your thumb 
482,no thanks  i shall blather my opinion and seek to engage in competitive voting  it s like reposting  but requires a little more writing 
483,who the fuck cares 
484,i downvote them for posting my witty hilarious comment faster than me 
485,and who s thumb are we ruling by 
486,wait  rule of thumb  in the early 1900s it was legal for men to beat their wives  as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb 
487,and then you get people saying that upvotes do nt mean anything because they are fuzzed and people upvote on a whim  or they delete  edit their comment and suddenly your vote means nothing 
488,fuck them  i want the karma
489,as someone who sorts by  new  andor  controversial   is hard to see who said what 
492,i ve got two more from the same ex  of whom i have two children with   1 after we separated  but not divorced   she drove halfway across the country to bone my  then  best friend  was her friend too   needless to say  that tipped the scales as to the direction of our relationship  with me and her and me and my best friend   2 about a year ago  i got served court paperwork in which she was asking the court for full physical custody of my kids  we have 12 legal and 12 physical now  and to move the kids across the country to follow her new military husband at his new duty station oh  and she wanted child support  we ended custody  change request  case about a month ago the court granted me full physical custody of my kids and ordered her to pay child support 
493,long story short  i had to pay my ex  1000 a month in child support  she did nt use it for anything but partying and drugs while my kids suffered and went hungry one time i was between jobs and she said i was  dead beat dad  one payment eventually my lawyer convinced the judge that the kids were in a bad environment  ie the new husband was a drug addict and 3 time convicted felon lol and i got the kids 100  of the time having gone through horrible child support issues i lessened her child support to  50 a month guess how much in child support i ve gotten from this dirty whore in 4 years  guessand the courts have done nothing  not that i give a shit i have my kids 
494,she sounds like a lot of people i know
495,gt   says my kids want to spend more time at her house so i let them gt   in court  she says i do nt spend all of my allotted time with my kids showing i do nt care about them    these   captions   are nt   guaranteed   to   be   correct 
497,he s probably hoping you ll learn to do it yourselves some day
498,there s something wrong here  i do nt know what it is tho

504,maybe not you but the system deserves it and that includes a lot of workers sure you have power but child welfare is a force for childhood trauma by itself here s just a quick note  when trained or educated  what is the equal amount of trauma caused by a parent that equals the amount generally done by removal of a child 
505, i agree

537,i supervise a restaurant kitchen  i once had a customer come in with three other people and ask the hostess if we used peanuts anywhere in our facility i told them that we do nt personally prep anything with peanuts  but we put a peanut allergy on our desserts because they are prepared in a kitchen that handles nuts the customer threw his hands up and responds  sorry  i have a peanut allergy and i do nt dine in any restaurants that handle peanuts  he turned around and walked out i saw the looks on his company s faces go from slightly hopeful to blank in an instant man  just do nt go out  or pack your own meal  but do nt drag everyone else into your extreme accommodations

556,people love to complain at bakeries about the fact that that what they sell might be contaminated with peanuts  either because the bakery has nuts or the products were manufactured in a place that also handles nuts the bakery i worked at had signs all over the place saying we could nt guarantee a product had nt come into contact with peanuts yet parents of elementary students got all up in arms because the cupcakescookies might have touched peanuts it took every faculty i had to not say  do nt like it  do nt buy it  i get that you might die from exposure and i m glad you re proactive about preserving your health  but please stop being a special snowflake
557,i have a bee sting allergy so i ca nt go outside at all in the summer because of the slight risk that i might get stung by a honeybee  yea  fuck that  i go out every day in the summer and often spend weeks camping and kayaking many miles from the nearest road enjoying life is more important to me than living in constant fear of what could potentially happen  also  you wo nt see me go to a beekeeping farm and complain that i m allergic  it would be just as stupid as a vegan going to 9999  of restaurants or supermarkets

572,i think you and my last landlord could commiserate i lived there for about 4 years  he had 2 units  and in my time i think he went through 3 people in the other unit the last one was a girl who lived there for about 2 years  had friends living with her  smoked  did drugs hell  she even had a guy die in her apartment from a heroin overdose the last day before she was being evicted they had every window open  smoke was coming out the windows enough that you might have thought they were burning more than just smokes they put tons of holes in the drywall the guy before here just skipped town one night and left almost a dozen bags of garbage in the apartment  some of which was food garbage i felt really bad when my time came to move out he was a great landlord as far as i know all he really asked was that you paid on time and did nt trash the place i think in the 4yrs i was there he may have come up to my apartment twice just to see how i was doing 
573,just include utilities in the rent  problem solved

576,or maybe they could talk about their problems with their so like an adult  even if they were just blowing off steam also valentine s day can be stressful for some  and some might have high expectations for valentine s day while the other does not

782,said it before and i will say it again if you go to places asking for relationship advice  they are either 1  looking for support in their decision  2  making sure they are nt crazy  or something they need to be talked into or out of  the understanding if someone comes in and says   i love everything about this girl  but have only been dating for 6 months  is it too early to propose   they are looking to be talked out of it  or to make sure they are nt doing something crazy the other case being  my boyfriend hit me and i am thinking that after the 12th time this has happened  i want to leave thoughts   they know they should leave  but want everyone to back them up  which is why every thread unanimously agrees usually it s painfully obvious in what the person should do

784,hi  i have worked in wildlife rehab and can likely shed some light on this topic for those who do nt know one of the most common problems rehab facilities face is the process of imprinting an animal onto humans  or a lesser version of that where the animal just thinks that all humans are providers of food imagine releasing an imprinted bear  the bear thinks that he belongs with humans and will go try to find other humans to hang out with or score food from this is how  nuisance animals  are made  and you better believe people will call anybody to get this big fucking bear off their property  around me it is usually the dnr and in most cases it is putting the bear down this is why you see rehabers wearing costumes or masks when working with wildlife to be released so that animal does nt know what the big thing with the food is here is an example of people working with cranes  https  media2wnycorgi1200627c80photologueimages4bop_mig_crane_costumejpg people are nt perfect and there is a cute affectionate fox to be taken care of  and it s easier than you might imagine to imprint an animal onto people  especially when said animal is very young what most likely happened is that the workers spent too much time trying to play or cuddle with the little guy 
785,not true buying them implies you intend to use them  meaning you ve thought through the possible effects of sex and are taking necessary precautions  yeah  it s awkward the first few times  but so are most things  especially those related to sex

803,above your door behind the drywall is something called a header it s a larger piece of wood that holds the weight of the roof over the open span that is the doorway you could screw a 2x4 to the header and hook onto that you could probably use a 2x2 as well to drop the height of the bar down if needed 
804,it s probably not up to code

816,i ve got a funny feeling that will be the last time she sucks anything of yours  ever 
817,that s not a reason to stay with her in fact  it s more cruel to her you should let her go so she can find someone who will like her for her and not for her family if you break it off right  you might be able to remain friends with her family and maybe even her  too 
818,last week the police asked if i could dig up some video for an accident that occurred outside one of our business locations girl was crossing the street  was struck by a speeding car  and she died it was snowing a bit but the car was speeding still i do nt understand how she did nt see or hear him coming i do nt think she was paying attention and i know the driver was nt  long story short you got ta lookout for yourself do nt count on the drivers to stop for you

829,my gf always texts me asking if i m playing games i play video games like 25 hours a week  but those 25 piss her off

845,did you know you can just buy lab coats 
847,do you even want contact with him 
849,plot twist  he needed 500 pages for his print job 
850,i do this because every time i print something that s collated  someone immediately prints something  grabs the entire print job  carelessly shuffles through it searching for their copy  which they inexplicably assume is buried in my work  instead of being on top  which it always is  and thereby forcing me to manually collate every fucking thing i print  every  fucking  time so fuck you if you do this shit 
851,flight attendant here the airport is busy and no one cares about you it s the harsh truth but tough keep your shit together and if you do nt know where you re going get out of everyone else s way by stepping to the side rearranging your bag in the middle of a security line or at the gate podium  or in line for the bathroom is socially unacceptable and i will run you over

869,i do nt see anything banning tastefully dank frugal flamingo may mays here
870,my fiance did the same thing   granted i m picky and only liked one type in the box but he ate that one too 
871,yea obamacare did nothing to actually fix the problems with our health care system it just ran everything through a government filter now do you understand why people were against it 
872,yeah i had an incident in highschool with a girl who had no situational awareness with her aim  and apparently never messed around with a guy that did more than dribble  and subsequently was the target of the situation it really isnt so bad that i couldnt tolerate it if say  girls tasted like that i wouldnt completely stop going down on them 
874,as a grown ass woman who is nt adverse to swallowing a load  i will say  it s not the taste so much as theafter effect  i do nt know what to call it ya know how when you puke and a chunk gets caught in the back of your throat and it seems to be stuck there with velcro and no amount of drinking will make it wash away  yeah  that but with cum it s not terrible  but it just feels a little gross sometimes like drinking milk with cotton mouth it just coats everything 
875,my husband was going to take me out to breakfast on valentines morning but i got up early to make him breakfast the offer was enough for meand i hate crowded places but if someone eats my chocolate there s gon na be a fight

881,so may things wrong in this scenario not letting the kid be independent  not buying stuff she really needs and taking care of them  gambling and materialistic purchases instead  just the withholding of getting a license and not getting glasses would be a cause enough to call your state s child protection services maybe that will light a fire under their asses to start taking care of their daughter 
882,or you could ve been responsible and checked ahead of time so scumbag you
885,you are kids that should learn how to post

905,if we re lucky  this is the first step to pop culture forgetting who he is 
906,south park the stick of truth  i ll probably never see it again after my friend lent it to his buddy 
907,why are verticals banned never understood why
908,or not even bother to pirate his music 
909,itt  people who think it s cool to hate on kanye edit  why does everyone think it s such a fucking sin to listen to kanye everyone s musical tastes differ  get over it focus on the scandal at hand 
910,and he wonders why he s broke 
911,he probably got a big fat check from tidal for being exclusive for a certain amount of time  and after than he ll rake in from spotify and itunes  where some people will likely buy it again 
912,cool story  bro 
913,you should always treat the customer rep with kindness and respect they do nt make the script or the rules they have to follow they did nt make the issue you are having they are trying to help you 
915,i have a rule that i never let anyone borrow my books because i collect them and some of them are worth a lot of money i made an exception for a friend of mine once because she was married to my cousin so i thought   i know where she lives  if she does nt return it i can just go and get it  well she fucking lent it to her cousin and i never got it back i am never breaking my own rule again i do nt understand why anyone would think it s okay to lend something that is nt theirs to someone but apparently this is pretty commonplace 
916,but if you do deliveries at night  what do you say then 
917,seaman and swallow get to work 
918,breaking news  album has been pirated over 500000 times 
919,not true 
920,so can anyone actually explain why certain meme are banned  really  what is the point  if it gets upvoted  why not allow it  do nt we all just come here to laugh  just seems like a lot of extra work and rules for such a simple concept  no disrespect to the mods anyone who does this kind of work for free clearly has a passion around it  but i m honestly curious 
921,i can concure  i have gotten refunds on things i should nt have gotten refunds on
923,i ve given people their pitiful dollar tip back in person you ca nt put a price on dignity or the look of shock on their face 
924,you should fuck your brother

928,wow  what a heartfelt confession it must have been so difficult to keep that all to yourself 
929,why not push her to a plug
930,you re on your day off  headed to the cafe to read a book or something for a couple hours run into this elderly fuck you help out because it s like eleven degrees and you know god s judging you so you help out  walk them home  uphill  in the ice  cursing your own mobility  considering offing yourself as soon as you are incapable so you re not such a pain in the ass for the young 
931,also  leave your favorite piece of clothing where you last saw the dog along with some water the smell will more likely bring them back than you calling their name for hours on end 
932,hmmm  interesting since when i talk to customer service and ask to speak to manager while thanking them for their help  and assistance with the issue  the manager tells me politely that their is nt anything he can do then my mom always seems to get pissed off and frustrated with customer service  and then usually gets free shitservices after asking to talk to manager and getting frustrated with them  i think this is one of those things where  if you are effective with either  and have the right person on the phone  you will get more help 
933,i m glad your baby is ok  op  nice to hear a happy ending for a change 
934,buy a bike 
935,i almost hit a lady and her daughter last night because of thisjust because im only doin 2025  doesnt mean i can stop a 4400 lb suv from turning you and your child into marinara sauce and she had the balls to lift her hands and scream at me like i did something wrong no  you dumb cock holster  you tried running across a 4 lane street in the dark  not at a crosswalk  while traffic had green lights  and still get mad at me  on top of all of that she was dragging her daughter along behind herfuck
936,i always wondered what the range was on those things any idea if she had just gone way too far or is her battery on the way out 
937,i wonder if her mlady app gave her an alert
938,i do nt get why pedestrians do nt realize that they can see you before you see them

942,holy shit you hid that one good op i sure would nt have seen that if you did nt point that out
943,why not just wait at the bus stop like everyone else 
944,this has been great so many redditors that constantly claim to be smarter than the media and kanye  falling for his blatant publicity stunt just because they need to hate him so many people that argue relentlessly that piracy does nt harm anything  going out of their way to tell everyone they pirated the album it s already the potential circlejerk of the year but no one is aware of how petty and stupid they seem 
945,it s a good thing they censored mohammed  god bless his soul  i would hate to be politically incorrect and offend isis 
946,as a nurse working in an er in boston  i concur most of the time  pedestrian struck  is  pedestrian frolicking through traffic on a busy intersection in a snowhailicerain storm

948,i had this same feeling towards taylor swift when she announced her album would nt be available on spotify
949,my cat and i just meow back and forth at each other i talk to my coworkers when i need fooseball opponents

955,i hate that people do not care about anything else but themselves
956,as a husband  you should have eaten them if you leave them untouched for too long then they re fair game 
957,have her go into walmart or target and try on all the cheap readers figure out what each eye is and order some online or buy a pair there getting something close to prescription will still be helpful to her 
958,no  i can not look at your ring   because i need glasses 
959,it s called natural selection thins the weak ones out of the herd 
960,i work in boston and i m pretty sure the people there have no value for their own life regarding their jaywalking habits 
961,or maybe we re just tired of hearing your stupid fucking arguments you have with your so and just want it to end while remaining supportive and clinging to our last bit of respect for you while listening to something you d be embarrassed to have put up with a year down the road
962,good thing you have a lot in common with your cat 
963,this is me right now thought it would be colder this morning so i threw a sweater on top of my collared shirt boiling hot at work  and now i m sitting in a sweaty  wrinkled shirt

965,i do nt really care about the relationship i just want the op to be miserable
966,lighten up maybe it s her first time 
967,canadian here you d think people who live in a country that has snow about 5 months of the year would know not to do this  nope  it s absolutely hairraising when someone decides to dart across the street and you ca nt stop quickly because of ice or snow  i really do nt want your deaths on my hands  people

978,the easiest way to get 100 comment karma on reddit is to browse rrelationships and suggest that someone stay in a relationship and talk out their differences instead of throwing the baby out with the bathwater 
979,when i worked in a produce department we had button up shirts and an apron to wear i only buttoned the buttons you could see above the apron 
980,if it is nt working for one person  that s plenty of reason to break up the other person s side does nt matter we re not deciding who s to blame  just that the person writing is nt happy 
981,i only iron the front of my button downs
982,if one person in a relationship has a bad enough story to tell you  then those people need to break up  1 person is to immature to give you the full story  2 relationships should make both people happy  if you disagree i think your a twelve year old girl 
983,i would buy some shirts at the thrift store and then cut the arms off above the elbow for comfort if you re wearing them with a sweater it does nt matter

994, it s pretty hot are nt you hot under that sweater     i m good 
995,wtf is an iron 
996,or maybe  just maybe  its all an act to get people talking about kanye do nt fall for it  if you do nt like him  just ignore him 
997,i do nt think kanye can fall hard enough that it will take down the kardashian empire  just enough for them to sell out even more and be more pervasive in everything so this is really a loselose situation 
998,lol button up under the sweater 
999,except he s not 53 million in debt as he himself said  his personal finances are fine his fashion endeavors have accrued 53 million dollars of debt from his investors 
1000,so your just saying you want to bang her mom or sister  or both 
1001,reddit loves giving advice without experience
1002,a foul bachelor frog who owns an iron  i do nt believe it 
1003,break up with her spend some time alone working on yourself
1004,gt  she always makes out with girls when she s drunk how the fuck is this not enough to make you question your relationship with her 
1005,kim s gon na divorce kanye and that album from that fallout will be glorious as fuck
1006,good for you  but that one sided story shows how the person views the relationship and if it is truly that negative then the relationship itself is not healthy 
1007,breakin  up is hard to do  this has been my week to be dumped  it is quite painful  do nt advise others to rush into it 
1010,  redditors that need glasses   gt   op posts son s girlfriend is not allowed to work  posts she should get a job
1011,stay away from rrelationships op  it may kill you  i swear over there it comes off as a bunch of gossipy people who have pent up issues in their own relationships just wanting every relationship mentioned on there to end bc no matter how small a problem it s a huge red flag and the relationship is fucked and gymlawyerfacebook and all that 
1012,after 8 inches of fresh snow i m driving down a street in my city and their is a guy walking down the street in my lane i slow down in hopes he will notice me  he notices but keeps walking in the road i honk  he flips me off i tell him to  get the fuck out of the road  he cusses me out and tries to kick my car i understand not everyone clears their sidewalk but you can always put on some fucking boots

1019,that s all they do in detroit on woodward between 7 and davison it like a goddamn game of frogger by the strip mall to be fair it s highland park but damn  it s bananas over there 
1020,as a new yorker  do nt tell me how to fuckin  walk 
1021,and in 99  of cases  we re only ever going to get the one side so we work on the information we have the bottom line though  is that if someone makes a scumbag stacy about their girlfriend on valentine s day either a  it s a joke and op probably does nt give a shit that the internet is mad at this fictional scumbag in which case why should you  b  op is nt entirely truthful and any shit he s getting is his own fault in which case why should you care  or c  the story is true as told and op really should break up  again  something you probably do nt need to care about  so i do nt see why you care the frontpage story we  did  get from an op who was told to break it off  gt  1 was unhappy gt  gt  2 broke it off gt  gt  3 discovered she s a piece of shit and is happier for it sample size is small but 1 of 1 is alright still having trouble understanding why you care 
1025,zenniopticalcom just bought a pair of glasses for like 10 bucks used them before cheap and works great 
1026,pedestrians had the right of way on my entire college campus when it snowed people would always step out in front of cars  i think that s where the myth that you get free tuition if you are hit by a car on campus came from 
1027,this is how teachers are 
1028,sounds like the someone s girlfriend needs a job 
1029,also  you have those idiots that wait till you re 20 feet away to pull out of their street  causing you to slam on the breaks and slide  happens every storm near me at the same street

1031,he s not wrong
1032,get the fuck in the left lane   assuming there is one 
1033,our kitchen at my old work was separate from our office room  up stairs and through a door we had a kettle in our actual room  but no water source so we would always have to go and take the kettle to the kitchen to fill it up every 5 or 6 cups of coffee one of my ex coworkers used to go and fill up his cup and then poor it into the kettle  so there was only enough water for him unbelievable  and no  it was nt a save the environment  thing tldr  coworker only boiled enough water for his coffee
1034,uhh hell no man  i think you would get shot saying something like that 
1035,sort of related  when i was growing up  i told my parents repeatedly i needed glasses i did nt get glasses for  years   because they thought i was lying about not being able to see and that i only wanted glasses to be cool  because  all  the cool kids wear glasses 
1036,hold my beer
1037,how old is the kid 
1038,am i the only one that prefers an empty pot so i can have a freshly brewed cup  i d much rather have that than burnt tasting coffee 
1039,your relationship is built on an altar of lies 
1041,that s alright they fixed their marriage by releasing a sex tape exclusively available on tidal edit  video  tape 
1042, asses and assholes  getting cheeky with kim and kanye 
1043,how do you know they re going to get divorced 
1044,in reality  it will be made to look more like a shit show than it actually is 
1045,i d love to be a fly on the wall at the divorce hearings you ai nt got the answers kim  
1046,i hope he becomes the next mc hammer
1047,especially when people find out it s becasue kanye is a secret buttpirate the tears will be delicious 
1048,that whole family has done everything they can to keep the ratings of that show up  it finally got so low before spurs to become kaitlyn  that did nt work out so now they re getting a divorce  my head hurts
1050,the top comment just has to be unfunny easy solve 
1051,maybe you should drive with a little more caution when road conditions are bad 
1052,i always feel like a winner people always stare with jealousy   that dude is getting laid sigh 
1053,that s not gon na happen anytime soon the way kanyes reacting to people writing her initials he still cares way too much
1054,why would you wish for a couple to divorce that has literally no effect on your life whatsoever 
1055,i know everyone likes to think this is a fake marriage or a superficial marriage  but i honestly think it s the real deal regardless  going through a divorce is shitty and i m not going to just openly wish them the worst
1056,she might have fake it and the other one too
1057,i do nt really have an interest in their marriage but it did cross my mind that if he really is 53 million in debt that she would be packing her bags when he wants to dip into her massive bank account 
1058,its fucking hilarious how redditors stand on kanyes sode with everything he does just because his music isnt to bad that guy is laughing his ass off watching all you nerds defend a millionaire  im glad i never got into his music its not special  mf doom  nas  de la soul thats my shit 
1059,when i worked in mortgage lending  we had one of those super industrial copiers that held 4 or 5 reams we copied every set of loan documents twice  once for us  once for the borrower   so we use a metric fuckton of paper i was literally the only person who d ever restock the entire tray instead of just sticking a handful of papers in it that office was full of assholes 
1060,wo nt happen
1061,better to play along than be an asshole like me and say  i saw it already 
1062,most likely has your number to make sure he doesnt answer probably meant to call  don  and not  dont answer   source  crazy ex girlfriends with daddy issues
1063,wow  that s a terrible thing  you used the meme right but i hope you know how terrible divorce is especially for innocent children like kim and kanyes it s a horrible thing to go through  and i hope when you wish this you realize what it means just because they re famous does nt mean they are nt real people  they are 
1064,why does nt he just get her to go on another quest to fight a dragon and claim the gold 
1065,why 
1066,are your friends  spouses in nickelback  bc that would make me hate them too
1067,this is a pretty brilliant strategy i have to try it on my friend who shows me stuff from tumblr that i ve already seen on reddit 
1068,my so does nt have a facebook but browses reddit does that mean i should send her facebook top comments 
1069,i ve created a monster  cause nobody wants to see marshall no more 
1071,and now to be the funniest guy ever 
1072,gt  we re here to have a laugh  hate speech  bigotry  and personal attacks are not allowed  those commas could be used better  that s slightly confusing at a glance

1079,so many people will know what you re doing hehe
1080,i have badgered everyone at two offices to   fill up   the paper if they find its empty the copiers can take one  at least  ream of paper and it takes minimal effort to put it in i hate seeing partial reams everywhere 
1081,i m breaking up with youjust in case 
1082,only if you lawyer up  delete facebook and hit the gym afterwards
1083,sorry man similar situation here  but i do nt think my father has or wants my number 
1084,do you have a recommended meme app 
1085,imagine all those times where you picked up your phone just in time to hear the other end disconnect  or where it only rang enough times for you to scramble to the receiver  those were nt accidents that was him but this time maybe he hit redial absentmindedly when calling a friend and ended up calling you again 
1086,i know how that goes i had one friend whose girlfriend i kind of liked she was funny  in the way that she s probably actually just mean and says bitchy things in a deadpan  but it always somehow comes across as a joke and i m ok with that and i started to appreciate her dry acerbic wit  until one day she proclaimed a hatred for the movie a princess bride and for all monty python movies  and then i did nt like her 
1087,what s the common denominator 
1089,this is using reddit for personal improvement 
1090,the real monster is op 
1091,summon the pitchfork emporium and let s get this fucker
1092,what s the matter  her arms did nt work either 
1093,because this is true  it s on the internet  it makes me reflect on how sad people s relationships are 
1094,marginally better than the guy who overloads it and then wonders why it gets jammed
1096,try teaching in a brokeass school that gives you one case of paper for the year folks get stingy in a hurry 
1097,back when i taught  i would put in paper for my copies  make the copies  and then take my leftover paper out of the machine and back to my room that shit was precious  and i was nt leaving my extras for some paper mooch to take  in one machine  we d have to put a phone book in the tray to raise the paper level high enough for the machine to feed  it was old and would nt feed the last 12 in of paper   of course  some idiot would end up not putting in enough paper and would break the machine when it tried to feed the phone book cover good times 
1098,my friend does this all the time so i made a rule if you can literally count the pixels in the videogifpics  do nt send it if it s more than a year old  do nt send it except if it s something really worth watching  take a chance 
1099,only do what you really must
1101,guy 1  my girlfriend cheated on me  guy 2  just be yourself  
1102,a lot of call centers have a call limit and will disconnect calls when they reach that limit i worked at one place where if we had 200 calls in the queue  if you called it would let you through the automated system  24 minutes of time  and then disconnect you with no message at all it could have been handled better  but the intention was that if we had that many calls backed up it was either a massive service outage or it was gon na be 1 hour before you got talked to either way sucked for the customers 
1103,it s ok if you re doing it for the lolz 
1104,pshhh fancy office people with their first world problems  unlimited access to copy paper  pens  pencils and various office supplies as a philly teacher  i was given 10 reams in september and instructed to  make it last till june   that was it in respect to office supplies 
1105,a crazy chick in my office does this all time we are convinced she wants to wreck every marriage and long term relationship in her general vicinity just for fun 
1106,more relationships need to end than you might think 
1107,i think that it depends on the personstory  if you re with a friend and they go on about their unhappiness  i think it s safe to say  maybe you should break up   if it s a coworker talking about how her boyfriend made her do something he asked  that is non of your business 
1108,yeah giving advice over the internet is nt the greatest 
1109,there s a special place in hell for people likeoh wait nope sorry that place is reserved for women not voting for hillary he s okay just an average asshole 
1110,you really are a sad sack of shit op i feel bad for you

1126,whachu got against flip phones bro 
1127,michigan here had a girl do this on me once and she dropped her phone she went back into the middle of the road to get it  stop  and check to see if it was broken  all the while  my abs was the only thing keeping me from hitting her  i thank god to this day that i caught traction

1235,i stopped ironing even that  and wearing underwear

1257,i ve learned not to loan my games to anyone unless im 100  done with them it just makes it easier
1258,it s harder to count what you need than to load a full ream
1259,maybe he s the guy who always has to reload the copier shit gets real old  i had to start doing something similar when my roommates would nt replace the paper towelstoilet paper 
1261,he got laid off probably for being terrible at work just like he s terrible at being a friend just a shit human being all around my advice  kill him 
1262,that s kinda strange as it s lazier to just grab a handful of paper and slap it in instead he counts out how he much he needs and then reloads 
1263,well i guess that s settlingtechnically 
1264,take his ass to the pawn shop to get a loan to pay you back 
1265,no  do nt just do nt i m glad you learned your lesson but it came at a cost just do nt let anyone borrow games the same can be said if you see how they treat their games as well if they hit or throw their controllers  then it s a no  if they yell at their game  it s a no  and this one if a big no for me as well when they have 1 or more of their game discs outside of their case for a long time that you start noticing  its a no no  because that shows they wo nt take care of their games  and they sure as hell wo nt treat your games any different 
1266,is anyone else imagining the girls version of this story with the dbag hat meme  this guy brought his dog over to my house then he did nt even bother to keep his eye on the dog  they had nt even been there 5 minutes when the dogwho had clearly been going through my personal items unsupervisedcame carrying my vibrator 
1267,who brings their dog to someone else s place 
1268,is it really too much to expect someone to do their job properly regardless 
1270,i will add that there is a homeless problem around here and they have come onto my porch in the past also  i had just gotten back from 8 hours of classes so i was burnt out and in a bad mood

1273,exact situation happened with my call of duty black ops  this man did me a great favor that day 
1274,the dude can afford an xbox one  he can afford to buy a game he lost hes just a dick if he doesnt even if the console was a gift he could sell it to give you back the game or just figure out how to buy a used version of the game in the coming month there is no excuse  hes just cheap and not acting up on his mistake 
1275,be passiveaggressive with him next time  if he is behind you in line  add a few color sheets to the paper
1276,every time i let anyone borrow something i know it wo nt come back in the same condition if at all  it s ridiculous that i have to expect that of even my closest friends  but it s the truth so i make sure i m done with something before letting it out there i do nt let them know this and i was nt always this way  but after items lost  stolen  sold  traded  and damaged yeah  i ve also yet to meet anyone who keeps things in likenew condition my books do nt have clearly damagedcreased spines or pages no scratches on discs or even their cases all manuals still intact and with them  i knew i was doing something right when i had a gamestop employee tell me i was crazy for wanting to trade in any of my items in the condition they were in 
1277,it takes less effort dumping a stack of 500 than counting the 17 pages you need 
1278,so of all the numbers he could have accidently dialed  he dialed the exact phone number of his kid  are you suuuuure that this is nt maybe a teeny tiny fib 
1279,til the  i should buy a boat  cat is from a bjork video 
1280,this is one of the many reason i stopped loaning things out to anyone period even close friends  i wo nt i ve had to buy monty python and the holy grail on dvd 4 times i stopped buying boondock saints because people would just come in my room in college and take it without asking 
1281,down to the sheet 
1282,never lend something out expecting to actually get it back 
1283,i use to be that guy  and someone caught me they threw a fit and i have never done it again  i did nt know i was being a scumbag steve a little knowledge goes a long way 
1284,latex or leather  i find it difficult to get the blood out of the leather sometimes 
1285,why does it feel like i ve seen this before 
1286,lent my buddy my ps3 with a few games have nt been able to get a hold of him for 8 months now
1288,my sister and her husband did something similar her husband broke my nephews 3ds that i bought for him then said he was nt going to replace it  then they bought themselves a ps4 asshole would nt let my nephew use the ps4 either i called my sister out on it  she told me to fuck off for calling her husband a piece of shit and disrespecting her husband i bought the kid a nintendo refurbished 2ds  my sisters husband kicked her out  and i lost all respect for my sister

1292,valentine s day is a sham 
1293,as a parent that is dealing with estranged children  you ought to at least hear what he had to say  have you never made a decision that you could nt change  sometimes people make choices that are not good i deal with this very issue now i ve tried to reach out many times  only to be met with silence you dont know what was in his mind at that time  but pray to whatever you believe in that you never have to make that choice for whatever reason because i will tell you this  everyday i debate whether the last taste i ll ever know will be hoppes  9 
1294,and you complain to reddit for karma instead of working it out with her 
1295,yeah  wellwhat does ucationbot have to say about all this 
1296,i work with somebody who did nt fill the tray once upon a time and when he was asked why replied   to save paper 
1297,i m all about the dickie life cut a couple collars with the top two buttons from dress shirts and then just wear them with a tshirt no uncomfortable bunching anywhere  and you stay nice and comfy without being too hot 
1298,i have a coworker who every single time the printer runs out of paper acts like he does nt know how to refill it and its broken i caught on quickly and i generally too busy to  fix  the printer for him 
1299,i m a teacher  i thought you were going to say  loaded the copier with goldenrod

1304,takes less effort to just fill it great job guy
1305,sounds like you got the right kind of cake
1306,speaking as an it help desk tech  i can honestly say this is 100  true if people are nice and respectful  i will go out of my way to do things we would usually transfer them to another desk for to save them time  and make things go easier  if they re a dick right off the bat  i am going to look for the most legitimate way to transfer their ass to whoever i can  even if i could actually resolve their issue i m not going out of my way to go above and beyond only to not even get a thank you and for them to abruptly hang up on me  if they really piss us off  we may or may not lock their account with  failed password attempts  just so they have to call back and listen to our glorious hold music for a bit longer 
1307,well  after spending  2000 on a bike for herself  she probably could nt afford one for her kid

1403,you sound like you might not know that you need some better friends 
1404,as scummy as that is  i had a friend borrow some games and a controller a while back  he sold them to gamestop 
1405,bullshit this coworker does nt have a phone number or address  employer would have both 
1406,i just hang my shirts up after i wear them repeat the process until there s a noticeable smell 
1407,thats a good idea 
1408,can confirm i ca nt count the number of guys in suits i ve worked with who do nt iron the backs of their shirts 
1409,it looks like now we re gon na need a foul bachelor tadpole meme 
1410,same thing happened to me with a coworkerbuddy who borrowed my 12 monkeys dvd  he never offered to replace it  another time  i lent a my team america dvd to my supervisor  who then lent it to my other supervisor  we had 3 over our team   never got it back  
1411,how is this advice 
1412,i have completely stopped buying physical copies of games i ca nt lose it i ca nt break it and i can not lend it out   oh hey i see you were playing gta v  can i borrow it    bought it digitally sorry bro  it s freeing no more  oh come on you can trust me look at my other games  not a scratch on them  and then without fucking fail i d get it back with a scuff  what happened    oh dude freak thing  i was taking it out of the case and the phone rang while my dog jumped on me and i spilled my soda down my shirt and so i dropped it  fuck all those people no more guilt trips  or coercion  or arguments  digital copy for life 
1413,i can only imagine that any time she shows you a picture in person  you say  errrrrr i got ta go to the bathroom   you snatch your phone up and run out of the room then come back 3 minutes later  immediately belting out a clever response right as you enter the room  then she shows you a second picture  uh oh  i ve got ta go to the bathroom again    
1414,my dad used to cut off his collared shirts beneath the shoulders 
1415,what he wanted to tell you is that when he left 13 years ago to go get that pack of smokes  is that he never smoked to begin with 
1417,he just lost his job the dude probably pawned it for money 
1418,yeah i work with this special type of idiot too thankfully i have my own printer now 
1419,irons collar  noob 
1420, oh brian   http  iimgurcombv72tbepng 
1421, and no left turn green light and a constant stream of cars in the other direction but you make it  
1422,i ca nt figure out how someone gets to be the person who borrows something and then just gives it away carelessly i really find it hard not to conclude that part of them just wanted to fuck up 
1423,dude still has it for sure 
1424,and do nt write that s what i was gon na say
1425,shes the one making the money and kids have to learn what a no  is 
1426,this is what you wanted to say
1427,she sounds like she needs a check up from cps
1429,i ve done this before when i noticed the printer was out of paper for a half day or more and everyone was too lazy to fill it 
1430,i find it funny that people try showing me things on their facebooks  i do nt have one  and i know everything they re showing because everything on fb comes from reddit reddit first  always
1431,nee naww nee naww here comes the karma theft police
1432,what a disrespectful dog humans are filthy 
1433,when i was 13 i had to beg for a cell phone
1434,none of that was a social interaction 
1435,he probably sold it for drug money why ca nt he contact his former colleague  i call bullshit on that let s just say if it was my game he would be forced to contact them he s probably just a lazy  worthless fuck that does nt deserve the life he has 
1436,i love it when the guy behind you starts flashing his lights and flicking you off as if he is so much more important than you 
1437,i had a buddy from work borrow a ps3 game years ago after a few weeks he actually just up and moved back to his home state i mean  i m sure he had some important stuff going on  but it was pretty annoying 
1438,omg march his ass to his former employment and respectfully request to speak to the individual who he loaned the game too if said person is not available  come back when he is  no phone numbers required just three questionable gentlemen discussing a simple issue 
1439,great service that guy provided but somewhere  on some page  he drew a tiny penis which is an even greater service 
1440,literally the reason i ve only done digital since the new systems came out friend s husband borrowed skyrim  then magically ca nt find it 3 weeks later when he starts moving because of divorce 
1441,i let someone borrow moder warfare 2 back when it first came out motherfucker snapped the disk in 2 after losing a round of hard core free for all and then refused to buy me another one because  it s not his fault that i let him borrow it  needless to say  his 360 was in more than 2 pieces later when he got back to his dorm room 
1442, repost bot   https  wwwredditcomradviceanimalscomments2s3fg5as_a_petite_girl_it_really_gives_some_peace_of 
1443,can it be both 
1444,you should take something of his
1445,my experience is that being polite gets me put in circles  whereas my mother s strategy of scream at them till they do what she wants creates results 
1446,former call center rep this is 100  true if you were nice and polite  i d bend over backwards to fix your issue rude  demeaning  or nasty  i d stick to policy and only do what i had to 
1447,lol you re not getting any tonight 
1448,where do you people find these  friends   jesus christ 
1449,who got laid off  him or his colleague  if the other guy still works there  your friend knows where the guy works  and can get ahold of him there plus since your friend is nt working  he has nothing better to do all day than to wait outside the guy s workplace  that is if he s being honest about it  which he is nt 
1450,ex tech support here  its really sad this has to be said  but its true be nice  most of the time the person on the other end only makes minimum wage  and probably does nt work directly for the company you are calling anyway  usually they are subcontracted to phone farms  a warehouse full of cubicles and shitty computers 
1451,am i the only one to notice the reflection of the text in the bottom of the picture  nicely done  op 
1452,and if you re rude  i ll float you into the pool and make you  wait on hold to be transferred 
1453,this reminds me of my brother nearly 2 years ago he made me lend him and his friend  27 so we could all go to the movies i figured i d only lend my brother the money since i had just met his friend  but he convinced me that his friend was reliable and that they d be getting paid that upcoming weekend in the end  i never got my money back from any of them and whenever i d ask if i could at least get the money back from his friend  he d just tell me that he lost contact with that friend and the money is as good as lost nice to know how respected you are among your family members _
1454,damn america be weird  we do nt just get to turn right anywhere in the netherlands at stoplights 
1455,i just came here to say the word peepee 
1457,i feel like  not  downvoting is sufficient 
1458,i can confirm i do enterprise support for network security appliances  if you are nt a dick or totally abrasive  i will advocate for you to make sure things work out to your liking  if you are unwilling to work with me in a tough situation i will probably only do what is required to get you off of the phone 
1459,i work in a call center currently  and it s simply just  treat everyone the same  meaning that no matter who you get on the phone  you have to help them out with their issue  or at least point them in the right direction  however  if that said customer is swearing up a storm or cussing you out  you have the ability to just let them go after a  3 strike  warning or hang up if it gets too extreme  had a cubicle mate hang up on someone after he was called a racial slur 
1460,i generally do sometimes with a reply like  damn  you beat me to it  1  
1461,i m polite to customer service most of the people i know are  except for one friend he s an absolute dick to them he enjoys calling up and arguing with them and he consistently gets far better deals than anyone i know  it is nt always true being pointlessly rude or demanding to them probably does nt work  but being mean to them effectively will always work out better in your favor
1462,de ja vu we have a new variation of this confession every week 
1463,i hate the assholes that are in the left lane  which is a turn only lane  and it has a green arrow but goes to yellow and then disappears then it goes green  still no arrow  but that means to yield and go if its safe fuckers here will wait for a turn arrow that only lasts about 10 seconds there will literally be no one coming from the other direction  dead street   and when i beep them to go either they get it or they flip me off and yell out their window  god damn floridians 
1464,how many comics actually fit with an rrating  deadpool  punisher  what else 
1465,when my new 600 dollar phone got rmaed and i was arguing with the rep about how i definitely did nt get water anywhere near my phone and the warranty was not voided by me  i was getting understandably frustrated i apologized and noted i know it s not her fault or decision ended up getting a replacement
1466,i ll be interested once details come out there s a big difference between having a positive net worth in the millions and having 53 million in debt  my guess of what the situation is  and having a straight up negative net worth of 53 million 
1467,the reason why people say that or comment the same thing is because they either did nt see the original  or more likely  they want karma upvoting does nt really do anything for the person upvoting so people tend to go the more selfish route
1468,i was very nice last time i called samsung customer support and all i got was no help and the guy feeling bad for not being able to help me because i was nt being a dick or yelling at him or anything so now i feel bad fuck you samsung and samsung management
1469,unless you re dealing with comcast 
1470,that s not what up vote is supposed to be used for
1471,i will go out of my way to transfer you to make a second 40 minute car journey to come back for a refund 
1472,can confirm used to be customer rep used to break all sorts of rules to help nice people 
1473,but it s so hard after the 4th time western union has transferred me to another stupid person     my job requires me to call wu to help customers sometimes 
1474, sometimes
1475,yeah im literally the nicest person ever until they become unhelpful dicks then i go from trying to get my problem fixed to making them fucking cry 
1476,careful  rhiphopheads might be upset
1477,i ve honestly been burned pretty bad being polite a few times  especially at airports the two times that stick out in my head are once when a flight was delayed and i missed my connection i was basically fucked by the customer service rep because i did nt forcefully explain i needed a room for the night and spent the night on the airport floor it s hard to explain the situation but there was a massive line of furious people and anyone who was nt outwardly belligerent was nt given the time of day  the second time started with great customer service from alaska airlines  the lady at the call center  in idaho  was amazing  actively tried everything she could to rearrange my flights and was unbelievable  we even had a chat about her daughter who was getting a graduate degree in soil microbiology i was so grateful  i asked if i could talk to her manager to give her a good review and she said it was just her job despite my insistence since then i have never received anything but the most bare minimum service from their agents if i ever find that lady again though  and every time i call to rearrange a flight with alaska and get a woman i ask if she has a daughter with a graduate degree in soil microbiology in the creepiest way possible  i also recall her name starting with s   i m getting her personal extension and getting her name so i can give her the credit she deserves  but the biggest things i learned is that with high volume customer service it s important to be nice  but you need to also be insistent  personally i have trouble with this still  because no matter how nice that representative is dealing with dozens or hundreds of people a day they do nt have the energy and people will begin to blend together 
1478,can confirm 
1479,as someone who has spent quite a lot of time working in cs  this is sort of true  at least where i ve worked   someone i worked with used a phrase along these lines    the bigger an asshole the tighter mine becomes   meaning that if a customer was a complete asshole  he d follow the rules to the letter and simply refuse to budge on the rules however  if someone was kind and patient  then there s a lot more wiggle room  my view was along the same lines  but with modifications i did nt mind dealing with angry and frustrated customers  and i am sympathetic with their plight i do nt care if they yell and swear  as long as it s not personal towards me with one exception  if i m the one who screwed up  then i m the correct person to get angry at  and to be honest  i ve managed to calm quite a lot of customers down by simply telling them  i m the company representative  so if you need to vent your anger and frustrations at someone  then i m the guy you yell at  in my experience it seems to be much more effective than  please calm down so i can help you 
1480,i wish my colleagues would understand that this is true towards staff and  patients  as well if you need them to do something  i ve had a guy nearly break his leg  again  in order to get into the position i wanted him to be in for his imaging because he wanted to be nice back 
1481,in a lot of cases  they see this as an opportunity to sell a bunch of useless bullshit to naive people  i try to be nice to them i have a breaking point 
1482,i work customer service for a large corporation in an industry notorious for hidden fees and charges a colleague and good friend of mine  was in his wedding  works for a company in the same industry and we talk about this a lot since we have to stand behind our companies  shitty policies  there is often yelling involved from the customer and it wears on you after a while  he once told me about a problem he had with his internet bill where  in order to resolve the issue  he said he had to  give them a piece of my mind  he yelled at a customer service agent when we complain daily about customer abuse 
1483,no  rule of thumbs up  much better name and i approve of it
1484,dae hate popular music and only listen to good music like classic rock     
1485,being rude gets you the bare minimum and increases your chances of  accidentally  being dropped while on hold 
1486,when cs is being unhelpful  i ve found that crying really helps get things moving rather than getting angry nothing makes someone more uncomfortable than a person they do nt know very well crying in front of them even on the phone  playing up the sniffles with a few bawls has helped me out in so many cs situations they have scripts for when customers get angry or frustrated  but i m guessing most places do nt have scripts for customers crying  i would only do this if being nice did nt work though and they re clearly in the wrong do nt make some poor guy listening to you wail just because you feel entitled to something 
1487, i thought i had mono once for an entire year  turns out i was just really bored 
1488,i m scared that if i stop all at once  the cumulative hangover will literally kill me
1489,former debt collector here  i can unequivocally say that if you were nice and genuine and actually talked to me  i would try and help way more than if you were an asshole 
1490,support rep here that s a definite lie no matter how nice or mean i m still giving you nothing and you ll like it  i may make you think you got something but you did nt i hate my life
1491,trying calling bell  phonecableinternet company in canada   i m not racist  this is where i say  but    but you get these people in india with the thickest fucking accents and no idea what they re doing it s a hassle getting someone who speaks proper english on the line 
1492,i am always kind to people that have to do some work for me it works most of the time i would say that it is better to be really persistent on the phone in germany at least  80  of the time first reaction is to say  nope sorry sir not possible i have to ask 25 help questions  to get things done
1493,there are running clubs  involuntary search parties 
1494,also if you lose your dog in a familiar area do nt go looking for your dog they will return  i let my dog run in the woods behind my apartment  i figured he wandered too far  i walked our path to the lake that we frequent no dog while i was looking for him  he decided to just go home 
1495,holy shit why is there so much hate for kanye 
1496,if you lost a dead body  contact the local hikers club 
1497,i have a samba whistle  which makes a very loud and distinct sound  and blow it in the house from time to time my hope is if dog ever gets lost i can go out blowing this whistle and he ll know it s me and hopefully be able to come to me 
1500,that s what my lurking ass always does 
1501,bull shit all the call centres i get talking to are in india or the philippines if you re polite at the start you will be kept waiting 
1502,also put out familiar things with hisher scent and your family s scent the dog can find you better than you can find it 
1503,this was always common sense to me same when ordering food 
1504,i understand op is rightfully feeling unappreciated  but something i ca nt quite put my finger on tells me he s one of those fedora  nice guy  types maybe it s the 5page love letter  i dunno 
1505,got ta do a quick scroll through the comments so i know i m not repeating anyone haha
1506,be in unfamiliar area know the members of the running club and where they livehow they can be reached so you can contact them  pick one 
1507,document  document  document that is what will help you the most in court  whether you re a man or a woman my cousin is in a bitter dispute with her soontobe ex and she was smart enough to save all of his abusive texts  emails  and voicemails for the last two years he cleans up nice for court  but the evidence helps to paint the shit back all over him 
1508,just be nice to people in general better things happen when everyone s happy seriously 
1509,local running club  is that a thing 
1510,as a mobile user  yes  this is exactly what i do with my thumb 
1511,based on this and your last post it sounds like she s the one who dodged a bullet here 
1512,i had a feeling after your comments on the last post that she was either cheating or had another guy lined up already 
1513,same plot twist  the girl was never ops girlfriend 
1514,goddamn i ca nt downvote this kinda shit fast enough  i m sorry but this shit is weak 
1515,you heard op  guys upvote shitposts 
1516,who s alex  is that where she gets kissies 
1517,who cares 
1518,that s a great idea as a fellow runner and dog lover this makes a lot of sense 
1519,this works the other way around as well even if you ca nt do much  customer service rep s who sound positive and understanding vs bored or uninsterested will come across as more helpful and the clients will generally be happier with the help have had cases of being told i was really helpful but a colleague was nt  despite giving practically the same answer the only difference was the tone of our voices 
1520,who the fuck is alex 
1522,my office has a customer service team a good few of them are pretty simple and i can see how customers get angry at them  but i agree  it does nt hurt to be a reasonable human 
1523,she was riding alex s dick behind your back i guarantee it 
1524,this sounds like a rich neighbor hood thing good luck doing this in the hood 
1526,that bitch was ready to fuck                female               dog 
1527,my bf is the dick that takes all the top posts on reddit and puts them on facebook for his friends to see so he s the funny guy 
1528,how do you know someone does nt listen to rap  they think kanye is a bad rapper  have ignored the college dropout  late registration  and graduation  and just  loooove  macklemore 
1529,i ve never understood guard dogs as pets if someone is breaking into your house with the intent to murder you  you think they re going to scream and run away because of a dog  they ll just kill the dog unless sarah mclachlan trying to murder you  i do nt understand this scenario 
1530,fuck her dude go out and enjoy a life she does nt pollute 
1531,honestly one of the most pathetic posts i ve ever seen on this sub  you done good op good  genuine confession
1532,reddit has such a lotion party for hating kanye 
1533,to anybody not getting  it s a success because that s what they want the dog to do with intruders not an easy thing to teach  btw 
1534,ca nt believe i never thought of this
1535,hope he drags the kardashians with him 
1536,its like everyone watches a south park episode that teases kanye west and then develop a completely flawed  empty opinion on him  without ever having fully experienced his work its pretty sad how people are so quick to hate on others without even recognizing their accomplishments or their work  its okay to have an opinion people but  for the love of god  at least have a well thought out reason for disliking someone so strongly im hearing so much criticism of kanye s musical accomplishments from people who i know havent fully experienced his work  only his radio hits and silly lyrics shit  i dont even like his character very much  but i most certainly respect him as an artist and as a musician i just get the vibe that a lot of people have only heard a gayfish joke or saw him interrupt an award ceremony and instantly blurt out   hes an idiot with a big ego and his music sucks  without having given him a chance at all
1538,was nt this already a meme 3 days ago  without the word girlfriend 
1539,my area in australia does nt have these kind of things so i ve decided to start an app  it ll be called  the running club  the rules are simple  the device will pair with other devices and match you you will need to run in the vicinity of someone for 510 seconds while awkwardly staring at them  once you are paired both of you will feel a slight buzz there is one rule to the running club  you do not talk in the running club  now that you are paired you both will run together and find your next victim  welcome to the running club 
1540,i m not worried about his finances he ll go bankrupt  or he ll pull out of the red  whatever  i m worried that he s actually losing his mind 
1541,why would it make you happy 
1542,a running club  now what is that 
1543,after living with two of them over the course of 8 years  i agree women are not nearly as neat and tidy as their reputation 
1544,sounds like manic depression to me 
1545,oh look it s this thread again
1546,that is fucking brilliant 
1547,he s a maniac but he understands how to draw publicity quite well there are shades of humility that can be seen from him  and i feel like most of what he does is an act  including this  he makes some pretty good music and i d hate to see him go if this were true 
1548,she sounds like a piece of work you are truly better off  though that may not make you feel better  it is for the best she s unappreciative and not at all the type of person you would want to spend your life with  or i would nt   as a woman  i could nt imagine acting like that sorry op 
1549,hillary clinton s first name has two l s
1551,first  real  job i had at 13 working at a movie theatre this was the first lesson from my manager he calmly walked me into the men s room and explained all you ll need to do is occasionally empty the trash and restock the toilet paper and hand towels then we hit the woman s room  they re animals bloody rolled up tampons  piss and shit all over the toilets hand towels and water all over the place   even if it did come off a bit harsh he did not lie one bit 
1552,saw a dog loose while i was out running thought it had a home so i kept running do nt know for sure but i can confirm runners see the most
1553,i ca nt remember the last time i hsaw something gross in a women s bathroom but men s bathrooms always smell like old piss to me 
1554,so in a way  we re all in a relationship with her 
1555,hmm my dog must have run away beep boop doop dop bop boop bophello this is your local running club how can i assist you today  yeah my dog ran away  yous guys seen him  why yes we have your dog boomer right here okay thanks i ll come and grab him from your headquarters located down the block this advice seems stupid to me 
1556,i m a chick  i m fucking disgusting the only reason i have sort of cleaned up my act is because i live with a man and he is clean i had to up my game so he would nt divorce me
1557,my wife always responds with  already saw it on reddit  huh   she knows i m not that funny 
1559,the letter was too long though 
1560,i lost my local running club  but my pet has no fucking clue what i m talking about 
1561,do nt worry she knows you are nt funny 
1562,one of the greatest lies ever perpetuated is that women are cleaner than men 
1563,i m sorry to say but you re an idiot and this is actually your fault you did nt feel appreciated for months so you went way over the top on valentine s day  that s on you reading about your valentine s day stunt made me feel nauseated  in the future do one thing on valentine s day  her favorite restaurant or handmade chocolates and if you write a letter burn it 
1564,plot twist  alex is her cat
1565,my little sister s dog absolutely freaked out at me one night when she was dozing and i suddenly walked in woke up  and charged at me  full on offense mode somehow that one time managed to freak her out it happens  and we were bros again in minutes  once she woke up 
1566,as a janitor for 2 years at a 5 star hotel pretty much everyone thinks i m full of     when i try to tell them this there may be some occasional mess in the men s washroom but nowhere near the consistent level of filth as the women s do nt get me started on the full moon  edit  psa for women  if you live alone or with other women and have men coming to visit make sure to lift your seat to make sure it s clean under there 
1567,op is definitely stage 5
1568,this is only helpful advice if you live in an uppermiddleclass white neighborhood
1569,one time i was out running and someone stopped to ask me if i d seen their dog i d ran all over the neighborhood but had no idea about their dog i could nt say to have seen anything because i was mostly just focusing on not dying 
1570,just tell him to give you  10 a week until you have enough to buy a replacement if he tells you  no   it s because he thinks you re a little bitch  and if you let him get away with it  you kind of are 
1571,i had something like this happen to me when i was a child my brother lent my copy of mario kart  double dash to a friend of his without asking me shortly after that they had a falling out and then he refused to ask him for the game back i never got the game back 
1572,when i was a kid my neighbor borrowed one of my games and then moved true story 
1573,solution  download your games  ca nt lose those 
1574,what an asshole i bet he ran the company into the ground to force layoffs just to fuck you over 
1575,thank goodness all my games are registered on steam or tied to my email these days no way in hell i can loan those out 
1576,this same exact thing happened in middle school black label final fantasy vii 
1577,2nd guy wants to fuck you just as bad and is taking the hero approach do nt be naive 
1578,he sold your game 
1579,i love getting people like that back 
1580,i have a feeling his  work colleague  is the kid who runs the fryer at mcdonalds 
1581,tell the scumbag to sell his xbox and use the money to replace your game no excuses  or just go to his house and take what you want to the value of the game and lend it to a friend  
1582,someone needs to make a parody of this video  http  youtubekwsifh8icaa  except when he goes to hand over the disc  dude kicks him in the balls and says do nt lend your games to dick bags
1583,lent a coworker a few of my favourite games  he quit and went  crazy  totally mia still annoyed about it 
1584,he probably stole your game  op 
1585,running club   bitch  i live in the hood 
1586,have you ever been to detroit 
1587,maybe their name is school 
1589,just contacted my local running club told me they do nt run thru my neighborhood because of all the robberies
1590,in an unfamiliar area if you re in the suburbs 
1591,i have yet to meet a woman in life who wants to date a guy who would write a 5 page love lettercringe you should have spent your time buying a dildo to double stuff her during a coke fueled fuck festaka  what alex does 
1592,wait  how the fuck do you even find the original post again  once it s off the front page it may as well never have existed  you ll never find it until it s reposted although these days that ll probably only be a couple of days 
1593,the other day my wife said  i do nt need reddit because i see all this funny stuff on facebook  i tried to explain really i did but it was useless 
1594,i like very cute
1595,5 page love letter sounds kind of intense alex probably just texts her something like  yo girl  i lt  3 that booty 
1596,the best revenge is moving on 
1597,i may admit i unintentionally do this too  pretty often
1598,who needs a club to run 
1599,that s genius and simple i think i should try this
1600,do you also steal confession bears  someone posted one almost exactly like this not too long ago but they just said  whenever facebook friends  instead of  girlfriend 
1601,to the creepy guy writing 5 page love letters  you are a creepy guy 
1602,i work in customer support  and while some agents are just dickheads no matter what  this rings true for most of them  sure  it s not an absolute  but it gives you a much better chance of someone really stepping up for you if you stay the call off like a pissy child the main aim is to get you off of the phone as quickly as possible  so you ll generally get whatever bandaid can be thrown at you the fastest 
1603,as a call center agent for over 10 years  if you are rude to me  i will put you on hold and tell you im doing something for you and then i sit there for a few minutes bitching about you to my coworkers i will then get back on the phone and tell you there is nothing i can do for you if you are nice to me  i will go out of my way to do everything i can to get you want you wantneed 
1604,my experience has been that at a 101 ratio they read from a script with little emotion and no willingness to really hear what im saying if you act like a robot  you will be treated as such 
1605,can confirm  worked in a call center at a large insurance company everyone starts at  20h and most are college educated so you re getting knowledgeable reps for the most part imo  the people who called in angry and bitching and degrading towards me i provided the bare minimum amount of service needed without being fired i would take 0 action to expedite any request they had  if someone calls in and they have an issue  it s literally my job to help them solve the issue  and i do everything i can to help nice people  cause that s my fucking job  why do people call in flipping out only the only person who can help them  i want customers problems to be solved  i do nt want to talk to unhappy people  i want their situation to be better so i do nt have to deal with them anymore  the angry ones  id just mute my phone and laugh  i would playback the calls with coworkers and then all laugh at said person together 
1606,if you call me up and tell me  my computer does nt work   and i ask you what the symptoms are  or if there s an error  and you tell me  i told you it wo nt work   you are going to have a bad time 
1607,i was always like what s up fam or bro or cuzz to them i try to treat them like a friend they have helped me in the most simplest way so yeah most of the time it works  assuming they re younger and etc
1608,as it support for a major corporation  this is an absolute fact fo me i do nt care about the time constraints if you re nice and friendly i will go out of my way to help you my ego thrives on customer satisfaction and resolution  survey question 4  overall i am satisfied with my it experience for this request  survey comment 4  best service i ve ever had dealing with helpdesk too_toked was excellent   swoon 
1609,ehh  only as long as the expectation is that they will have rude and bossy callers the rest of the time if everyone s nice and polite  then noone is 
1610,or they will be lazy and unhelpful  and feed you the company line because they want to get on to the next call rather than cleaning up the mess that their company created  like every cs person i ve ever dealt with on the phone 
1611,i have had numerous tech supportcust service reps go out of their way for me by catching their name  repeating it to them  and by being as pleasant as possible while trying to be direct in my approach to solving a problem hell  i ve even had great service from comcast through this method  last week a diagnostic lab rep told me to fax her a few things in after being pleasant with her and she somehow contacted my shitty insurance and saved me  80  it s actually really fun knowing that you re probably the nicestmost decent customer they talked to that day
1612,some people are just assholes and will act that way no matter what
1613,lol nice   i usually just pretend that i did nt already see it  but i might have to steal your technique 
1614,as a former call center employee  just be nice it actually goes a long way  d
1615,if you want to make them laugh at the end of the call when they ask if  there is anything else they can do for a minute  pause briefly then say something along the lines of  i do have some dishes in my sink that you could help with  i worked as a phone rep for a number of years and have done this countless times in the decade 99  of the time i get an audible laugh then i look over at my gf and she is giving me this look of horror because she hates it 
1616,are you in highschool 
1617,my 7 year old son had brain surgery and a coworker said that same thing to me i do nt care if there are people there to take care of him it will make both he and i feel better if i am there the boss probably does nt have a child people without children are usually less caring than those with children 
1618,we know that s a lie because there s no way to find a post on reddit once it leaves the front page unless you favoritedsaved it 
1619,lol  i agree with her 
1621,http  imgurcomdfpv6bk
1622,delete the gym  punch a lawyer  reddit up
1623, ayyyyyy 
1624,i m calling bullshit on this whole thing

1628,my wife and i sat at the local french restaurant eating a spectacular valentines meal and calmly discussing our divorce options we drove home  paid the babysitter  put our daughter to bed  and then went to our separate beds i played smite on xbox until 2am pretty good times 
1629,also  check adopt a pet websites with search criteria set to like 30 miles around your home  found my chihuahua 2 towns over in the pound up for adoption when she got lost  and invest in a microchip 
1630,you wrote a 5 page love letter 
1631,good  now step three  quit making scumbag stacy memes that shit is the cancer of the week 
1632,are you all in junior high 
1633,is her name jenny 
1634,yeah  we had a couple work together one of them gets in a car accident and she gets word he s in the hospital with a friend she goes to the boss who says   he s doing fine and  friend  is with him and can drive him home 
1635,used to clean the dunning at maccas and can confirm  the blood  oh my god the smeared blood  could nt believe it was such a regular occurrence not to mention the sliders left on the bowl  i guess women do nt have the control men do to be able to piss them away 
1636,that sounds like the answer of a man who does not have custody of his child  no one wants to wake up in the hospital alone it does not matter if we are 5 or 50 we still like to have company in a strange place what stranger place than a hospital when you re half out of it from anesthesia 
1637,genius life hack 
1638,  wan na play battle shits     https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  xsiasofr5e

1647,theres no shame here only wisdom 
1648,font 
1649,as harsh as it is  and i disagree with him  he has a point you being there would nt make any difference at all

1652,he s not actually in debt he has 100s of millions he just spent his own money investing into his own company that is nt making money back so he s calling it that even though it s not 
1654,do you think all of these kanye haters have ever actually listened to the mans music 
1655,nah i doubt it ll be hard to make up kanye is goat 
1656,she likes strawberry cake  ugh  dump her
1657,cat cat cat cat cat cat
1658,fuck you yeah  he s obnoxious but he has a kind soul and really cares about art and music why can people not accept that 
1659,i call that reddit assisted personality  i use it all the time 
1660,i worked in a night club for 2 years i thought they were taking it easy on me my first night by having me clean the women s restroom instead of the men s without getting too graphic  drunken women do exactly what a drunken man would do if they had to replace a tampon smack it against the wall by the string to leave blood splatters everywhere
1661,screams from the haters  got a nice ring to it i guess every superhero need his theme music 
1662,both sides have made these threats at different points bottom line is that so far  neither party has even gone through with blocking a nom i feel like the repubs have a pretty long hair up their ass this time just might happen
1663,an old roommate of mine trained german shepherds while i lived with him  his dog at the time  heidi  was so perfectly trained  you could give her sentences as commands like  heidi  go to my bedroom and get a pair of socks from the top drawer  and she would do it smartest dog i ve ever met  but could not handle losing the little light from a laser pointer  like  would nt sleep or eat for days sometimes laser pointers were banned from our house  anyway  roommate goes outside on a cold night to make a phone call he puts the hood up on his sweater while he s outside and he finishes the call as he s coming in the door he comes in and turns quickly to lock the door  hood still up  and heidi sprinted across the room  jumped up and pinned him  by his shoulders to the front door and barked and snarled directly into his ear  but did nt bite him he gave a command  in german  and she turned into a teddy bear again most badass dog ever 
1664, hey honey  what s your favorite kind of cake  
1665,women try their hardest to make themselves presentable while leaving a huge mess behind 
1666,haha me too we re so sad  
1667,can not wait for the opposite meme for when it attacks you too and suddenly its a problem
1668,that assumes i actually read other people s comments before i comment 
1669,plot twist is when his girlfriend sends him this picture and asks what reddit is  and if he uses it 
1671,i went to minneapolis acme comedy club a few years ago at one point  the line for the women s room was at least 8 deep  and not moving guys room was no problem  at some point  every toilet in the women s room was clogged  except one so they switched them women s line was just as long  guys just as short  but let me tell you  the things i saw in the women s bathroom almost made me vomit the bin for sanitary napkins was literally overflowing 
1672,success 
1673,women shit like banshees 
1674,fuck you  you do nt know me 
1675,she must be getting pretty sick of  ops mom  jokes
1676,repost from an admitted deceiver 
1677,i m really glad i m not the only one that does this i put it in quotes without a source 
1678,you nasty motherfucker 
1679,i think that s genius  
1680,serves her right 
1681,that  s brilliant 
1682,i would nt expect anything less
1683,pls clap
1684,i bet you say  repost   a lot 
1685,repost is old
1686,so  she shows you a pic you ve already seen  you look for it again on reddit and look for that picture again and tell her the too comment  because there s no way you remember every single comment of every single picture on reddit 
1687,anyway to stay fun
1688,suck my dick 
1689, women  say that women are cleaner than men 
1690,the first time i cleaned restrooms at my new job there was a massive pile of shit on the seat and floor of a woman s toilet it was also splattered all over the sink from them washing there hands the guy teaching me replied  now you know why i m gay 
1691,wtf is that font
1692,my gf does this all the time but i am too lazy to translate the top comments  english is not our first language  so this strategy would not work 
1693,my boyfriend does the same thing thanks op  i m doing this now good lookin out fam  edit  word
1694,reddit is a verb now 
1695,the majority of jokes people tell in reallife are taken from other people anyways  so is it all that different 
1696,fuck off i always downvote people who agree with me in the hopes that people will feel bad that our opinion was being downvoted so they ll either gild me or upvote me since i m the top and fuck the rest 
1697,you and everyone else in my facebook feed 
1698,when i was younger i was a housekeeper for a hotel and learned that  by far  women are grosser than men 
1699,if i were a landlord i would ban space heaters  not lend them out as an electrician  it s great that 80  of my residential winter work comes from people nearly burning their houses down by using a space heater but if it were a house i were responsible for  i d have a strict no space heater policy those things are terrible 
1700,have nt you seen amy schumer s comedy  girls are gross 
1701,if i made my living by people  i d sure as hell make sure their lives were as good as possible 
1702,female here and i want to state for the record that in the past  and even a little bit in the present  that i have achieved new levels of disgusting  just ask my previous boyfriend andre   he s really a champagne bottle  shhh   take that  society 
1703,i worked as a dock workerjanitor for 2 years at a high end clothing retailer that shall not be named the worst thing i saw in the men room was someone really needed to go and sh  t got on the under side of the seat the worst thing i saw in the women s was someone scooped out shit from the toilet and smeared it all over the stall  there were lines from where the fingers were  and on the mirrors outside of the stall  where you would wash your hands   plus we had a fewtimes were people shit in the fitting room  both were in women s only fitting rooms i would rather clean the men s room a million times then ever have to clean the women s restroom like that again 
1704,no fuck you 
1705,my grandparents managed apartment complexes for as long as i can remember their favorites tenants were single men  the said when they moved out their places were spotless  their least favorite were single women  they said they always left everything an absolute mess and they are nt the only ones in that position who have told me similar stories which i always found interesting 
1706,but if it were a house i were a house i were a house i were responsible for  i d have a strict no space heater policy 
1707,i ve got female roommates i still have no idea what the fuck happened to the kirkland pack of toilet paper i bought one week ago 
1708,the one thing that really sucks is when you want to see if somebody already said what you want to say but there are thousands of comments and you ca nt go through them all so you post one and then people come down on you for posting the same thing twice 
1709, get this man a gin and tonic  stat  
1710,no this is why i can never find the useful comment that s buried under 10 top replies that are stupid jokes or cliches 
1711,what you were going to comment 
1712,sounds like my ex 
1713, op is a karmafarming repost account and they re going to  advise  this    http  iimgurcomkdytijbgifv 
1714,if i get downvoted i just downvote the comment that downvoted me 
1715,well done that brother
1716,aw i love your brother haha
1717,but how will i receive karma for my hacky premise  
1718,fuck that  downvote them for stalking you in the future  like when that car in front of you makes all the turns you re about to make 
1719,rtitlegore i seriously had to read that title like four times before i reallized what it was saying  good on your good guy brother apartment manager though 
1720,you re only supposed to upvote things that are adding to the discussion 
1721, rule of thumb     https  youtube4e1weruuceg 
1722,physical dependency is what makes alcoholics alcoholics are nt rare 
1723,or hear me out  quit taking reddit so seriously 
1724,does his damned job  helps elderly when needed
1725,you guys need to buy that guy dinner or some booze or something do nt be mooches too 
1726,still write your comment and hope for karma 
1727,more like rule of wrist
1728,if there was a way people could anonymously kill me the last thing i would ever do is share that info he better hope he never pisses anyone off 
1729,this happened to my friend s husband he was hiding severe alcoholism for years and she ended up taking him to the er because he had flulike symptoms and was hallucinating turns out he tried stopping on his own and ended up spending a week in the hospital  highly medicated great news is he has been sober for over a year with the help of inpatient treatment and aa 
1730,but that would mean reading through all the other comments i m not here to read things or learn things  i m here to post things for karma   bet someone else already made this same comment 
1731,read every comment before you comment who has that much time
1732,i would have been very tempted to post that picture that she texted you on facebook 
1733,how old were you both at the time 
1734,c u n t 
1735,why would you complain about no one having ever bought you a cake  i mean i get wanting a home made one and dropping hints and whatnot  and then not being pissy when it doesnt happen because life s rough  but store bought cake  that seems so impersonal do they come with a gift card  too 
1736,well if she has never received a birthday cake before  how could you possibly expect her to know  how to receive one  
1737,i d get her a strawberry cake and then when she s all happy about it i d smash the chocolate cake on top of it  smooshing it together  and silently eat as much as i could 
1738,what kind of shit boyfriend buys the wrong flavor cake no wonder you re single
1739,i once told my  ex  girlfriend that i never had a birthday party that year  she threw the best finding nemo birthday party a 27 year old could ever ask for all of my friends has to wear little party hats and everything i really appreciated it and felt truly special the point your ex is a piece of shit and should have appreciated your gesture 
1740,often people like to bitch  do nt really want it fixed if you do fix it your actual taking away their victim identity and this part of them lashes out  it is not her fault  because it is unrecognized  and most are not mature enough to admit the truth to themselves and will run instead 
1741,i had a exbestfriend like this i customized a cake for her that had her 3 cats  pusheen style  with rainbow icing on the edges and her favorite cat in the middle with a rainbow tail it was a totally awesome cake in my opinion  but when she got it all she could say was how mad she was at her boyfriend for not getting her a mermaid cake she was even yelling at him for  being so stupid  and forgetting to remeber that she d  always wanted a mermaid cake   she never even bothered to say thank you and proceeded to mope for most of the night i know this sounds like a five year old throwing a tantrum over not getting her mermaid cake when she had a perfectly personalized kitty cake  but it was actually her 24th birthday 
1742,that s just evil women always seem to have the craziest expectations from guys 
1743,if you did not shove her face in the cake and walk out you should be ashamed of yourself 
1744,buying something for someone as a gift just because they whined about not having it does nt make you a gentleman  it makes you a sucker enjoy your life lesson and move on
1745,it seems more that he never acknowledged her and also she will be forever bothered by the fact that he never acknowledged her and also she will be forever bothered by the fact that some women do nt show the crazy one 
1746,i feel you op  i really do  but it kind of speaks volumes that you did not know your exgf s favorite type of cake  especially when you planned on getting her one this is nt really scumbag stacy material 
1747,fine 
1749,rule of thumb  ca nt hardly do anything with that should really be a rule of wrist 
1752,very true  this is why i found the original post from three years ago and up voted it good job op 
1753,this 
1754,this s how shitty  obvious jokes get upvoted to the top of every thread 
1755,or post a new comment  preceding it with  ca nt believe nobody has said this yet  but 
1756,every comment i make is original because i refuse to read the comment section before i post 
1757,all you can do is do your job as good as you can  and hopefully the kids get to stay away from the really bad ones 
1758,i just repeat it as a question like a boss  gt  big boss 
1759,sorry  but rediquette insists that the downvote button is not a  disagree  button by extension  the upvote button is not an  agree  button  so i ca nt just upvote because i agree  i can only upvote due to post quality and my post quality is usually shit 
1760,waityou could get fined for not clearing your  own  driveway  america be crazy 
1761,the bain of my existence
1762,f3 is my best friend when i do this 
1763,advice your post pick one
1764,i think you mean post the same thing while downvoting the original to increase your odds of success 
1765,but then how would people know that i m also funny
1766,average redditor rule of thumb  i do nt like this post  downvote  i do nt like this person   downvote  they posted this before me  and got more attention   downvote  i do nt agree with this   downvote  they state a opinion or personal experience pertaining directly to the topic of the thread  downvote  rinserepeat most do nt read the rules  even fewer follow them 
1767, how  dare  you think the same thing as me before i thought of it    furiously downvotes 
1768, what about rule of the wrist  
1769,no  downvote because we were both unoriginal 
1770,do nt tell me how to use my upvotes
1771,or downvote them for being losers with no life who beat me to the comment section by on average 612 hours 
1772,do nt care about internet points there s advice for you 
1773,dogma duck 
1774,downvote  post the same comment and revel in your victory
1775,apostrophes show possession or contraction you meant to say exes
1776,do i have to 
1777,reciprocate 
1778,you owe that man a 6 pack 
1779,ca nt do much damage with that now can we perhaps it should have been rule of wrist 
1780,the other day my buddy and i were walking down the street and we passed a girl waiting for the bus there was a guy there with her and he was obviously drunk and obviously she did nt want to talk to him but he was being a bit insistent my buddy told me to hold on one second and he stopped and stood between the guy and the girl he popped his earbuds in and pretended to be waiting for the bus too the drunk guy said something obnoxious to him  i m not sure what  but my friend just pretended that the music was too loud in his earbuds so he took them out and said   what was that  friend   again  the drunk guy said something obnoxious and my buddy just said   is this the stop for the 57 bus   the drunk dude just kinda stumbled away and my friend saw the bus coming from up the street as soon as it got to the corner  he turned to the girl and said   i just wanted to make sure you got on your bus without that asshole giving you a hard time  i do nt know if i m describing it well enough but basically he pretended to not even know what was going while he saved this girl from a kinda scary time waiting with this obnoxious drunk dude he did nt make the drunk guy feel like a jerk or confront him he just quietly made him feel insignificant and that was enough to make him scuttle off  overall  my buddy handled the situation superbly  meanwhile i stood a bit up the street just watching like a dummy  
1781,fuck you and your lazy ass roommates i hope you get evicted or change your shitty ways 
1782,hah you must live next to my dad 
1783,i was just talking about this yesterday and planned to make a similar post so my question is  while you were spying on me  did you notice where i put my mail  there was a cheque in there and i need it  thanks 
1784,i m a perfect world they could only tell you if your password is wrong if your username is right  though 
1785, came here to say this 
1786,this is reddit be civil guys
1787,downvote those assholes for stealing your comments
1788,great minds think alike  i just wish i thought of it a little faster  
1789,or alternatively  make your own separate post obliquely referring to the other post being commented on  because link karma pls 
1790,this
1791,they do nt tell you that for your security 
1792,i thought it was 190   
1793,did you hear that sanders wants to raise taxes to 90   also he has added free prostitutes to the list of shit he wants to give away  that ll make everyone fee the burn 
1794,the proper retort is  yo mama so fat  it s the only place i could find a picture of her 
1795,why are you on reddit during a date 
1796,had a similar conversation when someone saw my  animal porn  tab 
1798,the shitty reality  the majority of relationships i see are destructive based on need and insecurity rather than anything positive  and its not a young thing either a few years back an older family couple were given a big party for their 50 years of marriage and everyone was congratulating them  but the actual reality  he was an abusive drunk  and when he finally died  she got her life back but we crave this bullshit fairtytale  forever after   when we should be praising quality  not years are you good for each other  do you add to each others lives  are you just a homoenous blob  together so long that the idea of being alone puts so much fear into you that the idea has to be shut down  if so  get out and quickly go cold turkey for a year  face that wall and then start again but go for the positive pepople  the folk who show love daily  not in gesture bullshit like flowers or gifts  but their damn actions  day in  day out thats love  its the small things  but ultimately its about putting the other persons happiness first  and if you both do that  well you might stand a chance   anything else is a cancer which will eat your time and you wont get it back i grew up with some family friends  childhood sweethearts he was a cocky know it all type  but a nice guy when they hit their 40s she confessed she never loved him and left him for his best friend  who she had been having an affair with he changed  and within a few years he had a heart attack and is now a shadow of his former self  a recluse and lost his life pulled away from under him but again  every  aaaaewed  the chidlhood sweetheart line  subtly pressuring them to stay together  and she did and thats what we wanted  this security that childhood sweethear shit is real and we can get swept of our feet and live the happy ever after but its usually not like that  most of the time the euphoria felt is the inesecrity being temporaily filled by the validation of someone elses love and thats hard to let go of  as when things turn sour  you have to have that validation taken away  get it for yourself first  then take that into your future and see what happens  
1799,all these good works    sounds like he has a good heart and knows jesus 
1800,upvote for happy sweet story
1801,space heater  oxygen tank  bro s lookin for some inheritance 
1802,that title was a tough one to get through 
1803,tell him to be careful with those space heaters every week i hear about someone going to sleep with one on and it shorting out and burning up a house or something 
1804,watch her be rich as shit and you brother get a ton of money
1805,this reminds me of when i worked concessions at a movie theater we had a lady come in with her grandson after finding out the popcorn was made using coconut oil she stated  he has a peanut allergy so we are avoiding all nuts  i then said  coconuts are fruit  her  triumphant  response  then why is nut  in its name  at this point i stopped caring and did nt bother to tell her that peanuts are legumes and not nuts 
1806,where do i sign up for an apartment 
1807,he s probably just mad because he ca nt ever eat at five guys the peanut shell pollen there is amazing 
1808,i very much dislike the fact that we as a society have abolished common sense we d rather make blanket rules to avoid anyone having to think for themselves or be responsible for their own actions  op if you re ever near tn  i ll be happy to buy you a peanut butter sandwich with nutter butter cookies for dessert 
1809,as an apartment maintenance guy the oxygen amp  space heater mix worries me if that space heater malfunctions your bro is going to be in a world of hurt especially since he s turning it on for her the top ignition sources in residential settings are space heaters and power strips 
1810,some people never got bullied  enough  in school
1811,sometimes i need to hear stories like this good karma will come back to your brother 
1812,lending a space heater could lead to direct liability if there is a fire i just leaned this from a lawyer when i offered to buy a tenant a space heater while their furnace was being fixed they told me never to do that 
1813,so illegal 
1814,you should start leaving packing peanuts in his cubicle just 2 or 3 at a time 
1815,apostrophes
1816,good human being 
1817,time to start collecting charlie brown memorabilia cover your desk in pictures and figurines stickers on your notepads and everything i would bring in a little red snoopy dog house and place it in a very visible place on my desk sing the praises of charles schultz  i would then sit in my shrine to peanuts and give them the dead eyed stare every time they walk by 
1818,i was serving a table at work once one woman asks for a burger with the salad and makes it very clear that she is allergic to celery and wants me to make sure that there will be no celery added to the salad okay  no problem  we do nt put it in the salad  only as a side on other dishes  but no worries i ll tell them to keep it separate keep in mind that it states very clearly everything in the salad right there in the menu  i bring the food out  no celery in sight  everything good    yes  okay moving on  check back 510 mins later  still aokay  then the time comes to remove plates and ask about desert  etc   how was everything   it is at this time i notice that this same woman did nt eat hardly any of her celeryfree salad   the burger was fine   she says   but i could nt finish my salad   oh i m sorry  what may have been the problem    well  you see i m allergic to nuts  and there was almonds all over the top of the salad if i had eaten any i could have died   allergic to nuts  that s pretty serious  i think to myself  you would have thought that maybe with an allergy as serious as that she would have said something maybe included that when she was being so specific about a less common celery allergy which seemed to be such a concern with the salad that listed almonds as a main ingredient  it gets better   oh i m very sorry about that  i would have made sure there were no almonds along with the celery if you had let me know  and then  one of the guys she was with had the gall  edit  to tell me   well  when she said she was allergic to celery you should have asked her what other things she was allergic to so that you could make the kitchen do it right   they did nt want to speak to a manager they did nt want a refund they did nt want a remake i do nt fucking know 
1819,your brother might be banging an old lady 
1820,in bird culture that is considered a dick move 
1821,rtitlegore
1822,thought this was rsubredditsimulator at first
1823,victim complexes are going to be the biggest social problem of this century
1824,damn  my landlord is my own aunt and she s a bitch 
1825,reminds me of when my old coworker came to my desk and rudely said  give me some nuts    i had been sharing peppered cashews with my closest cube mates  when i turned around to pour a helping into her hand  i plainly said   here s some nuts  fast forward a week to me getting called to my directors office where they and my manager could nt even keep a straight face asking if i offered my coworker my nuts she apparently thought i was being crude and ended up getting laid off not long after 
1826,i thought it said something else instead of  tucks her in at night 
1827,i offered my allergic supervisor a piece of a macadamia nut clif bar and he gave me 3 points took it to corporate hr and got all my points removed which was pretty neat 
1828,just want to point out that  gt  in those who are severely allergic  reactions to peanuts can occur from ingesting just a trace amount this can cause anxiety  especially with the parents of peanut allergic children but did you know that touching  smelling  or inhaling airborne particles from peanuts does not cause a severe reaction  simonte sj  et al relevance of casual contact with peanut butter in children with peanut allergy j allergy clin immunol 2003 jul  112  1   1802  found here  http  wwwpeanutinstituteorgeatingwellallergy so it seems overkill to get them banned  imo  when only ingesting them will give a reaction  but i am for keeping allergens away from people who would be poisonedkilled by them 
1829,careful with the oxygen amd heater 
1831,jesus fuck  til that peanut allergies are classified as a disability that must be accommodated in the workplace  under the americans with disabilities act 
1832, no  thank you i have food allergies  why is it so hard for some people to just say that and not launch into a tirade 
1833,kindness and taking care of someone like that is insanely sexy
1834,people are fucking stupid someone reported me to hr because i always offered to buy my friend a coffee when i was going to buy one for myself and i never offered the same to them  a random person they thought that i was a racist  and the reason i was nt offering to buy them a coffee was because they were a different race to me 
1835,if more landlords were like this maybe i would nt assume they are all scum sucking pieces of shit 
1836,this is what happens when kids are coddled in school 
1837,as someone who is allergic to peanuts fuck this guy i only care when peanut butter is smeared on equipment  which has happened 
1838,many hr people take something small and run with it i bet your interaction with the dude was along the lines of  hey man you want a cookie    do they have peanuts or peanut butter in them    yeah  i think so   no thank you then   alright  they re here if you want one  he probably said something innocuous around a busy body like  i hope i did nt offend yipperoo by but taking a cookie  just the peanut allergy and all 
1839,puts chloroform in oxygen machine  has good time 
1840,to be honest this sounds like more of an issue with the company than the person all of these advice animals can be taken in a completely different manner the dude has allergies  he got offered something that reminded him that he should probably tell hr about it  and then hr flipped out  context you have none 
1841,i hate to be the one crying foul here  but i ve worked with kids at camps in the past who had severe nut allergies to the point if you ate a handful of peanuts and then breathed in their direction from a few feet away  the kids could have a severe reaction to it maybe the guy in the op s story was just trying to be a dick  who knows   but maybe that guy could have also had a severe allergy similar to the kids i ve encountered and the only clear solution was banning nuts just a thought 
1842,in 30 years  america will be wiped out by a peanut bomb from north korea
1843,and how are you helping the elderly  huh op  but seriously what a swell guy 
1844, it s this guy   http  imgurcombkgmqxc 
1846,fuckin great dude  please give him our kudos  amazing guy not many still care for our elders as we should 
1847,people like this are fucking poison in a work place act like nothing is wrong to your face  cuz they do nt have the real balls to talk to you face to face in the first place  and then go bitch about you to a manager  hr  and most often other colleagues best way to stop this  open communication and leveling session  s  with everyone about everything you feel needs to be addressed someone said something that irked you  pull them aside and talk to them about it a good hr employee would ve asked them if they talked to said employee about this  but it does nt sound like that s what happened and as someone mentioned already  this reaction was way overkill and if anyone starts to bitch about a coworker to you  stop them odds are they re talking shit about you too tell them if they can tell you about it  then they can talk to that employee about it why the hell ca nt people have a grown up adult conversation with someone  only if you ca nt get something resolved by talking to that person should you go up the chain of command fuck people  this is nt hard 
1848, when you take a chance using a meme incorrectly   http  iimgurcomz8bxmdegifv 
1849,if you are unwilling to communicate properly with your significant other and want to be passive aggressive  and think relationships are all rainbows and butterflies  you should definitely break up if you understand relationships are hard work  stick it out this guy is either in the honey moon stage  single  or does nt know what the fuck he is talking about 
1850,what if my meme was made while lying for karma 
1851,wait whatever happened to the scumbag stacy meme 
1852,i do nt trust anyone s opinion of someone if they re immature enough to be making memes about them 
1853,could have made this an advice mallard  just saying 
1854,but some people are drawn to the drama 
1855,i do nt know should you break up 
1856,what if you made a meme talking about people who made memes 
1857,rrelationships is leaking 
1858,if your still talking about valentine s day after valentine s day  then please shut the hell up 
1859,so if you do it on any other day  its okay  but on valentine  its a sin that can not be accepted 
1860,none of this would have happened if you would have just done the  door test   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  hajdqzrm6dwamp  t  1m18s  or at least a modern equivalent
1861,apologizes for doing something he knows he should nt do does it anyway
1862,rrelationships
1863,that s what i did last year she was a bitch to me and we broke up 3    days later month later i met my current girlfriend and could nt be happier 
1864,and if we really think about it like adults and maybe working something out as opposed to your so is a passive aggressive meme on sunday 
1865,if i made what 
1866,actually i thought the stacy who hated the flowers  love poem  dinner  and chcolate is the perfect girl  as i tried to explain i used to suprise my wife from time to time with flowers and she seemed kinda underwhelmed i told her okay i am never buying you flowers again i save soooo much money  this guy never had write stupid poems make chocolate  way easier to buy anyway   no more dumb flowers perfect girl 
1867,on the topic of using it incorrectly  this model is much more attractive than original scumbag stacy 
1868,but i made one based on my roommate s shitty girlfriend do i have to break up with my so 
1869,just do something nice and try not to get pissed when you do nt get a pat on the head you sook
1870,you used it well i d say special cases are cool 
1871,le meme generation
1872,should be an advice mallard  scumbag steve  scumbag stacy combo it s advice  and advice best heeded by both sexes 
1873,but i still have my cds in her truck 
1874,i feel that the  scumbag girlfriend  meme should really be pushed for a name change to  i m a pussy  meme top line   i planned a  3000 romantic adventure for my gf  bottom line   she had sex with my brother  insulted my cat and forgot to flush after a a super smelly shit dating sure is tough  really  then why the fuck are you dating her you pussy  something tells me valentine s day was nt the first case of this happening  same with scumbag steve this  friend  treats you like this  then stop fucking associating with him ya dumb fuck  problem solved  
1875,what if she s really hot 
1876,making an actual advice animal with actual advice is  using it incorrectly  now 
1877,why does reddit think relationships should end over literally every little thing
1878,you are nt actually sorry  
1879,yes  because making memes is so serious business and valentines day for sure is nt just another day 
1880,not really no one is perfect people make mistakes i m sure your significant other can think of a hundred times when you were a scumbag steve some people just like to mine for karma 
1881,you could have put  if you made a scumbag meme about your so on valentine s  you should break up  on the kermit meme but that s none of my buisness 
1882,well i mean how else do you get it out 
1883,then he spackled the hole and painted over it 
1884,backing it out hurts less than using the claw end of your hammer to remove it 
1885,my dad did this when he accidentally screwed his hand to a board while renovating part of our basement he said the worst part was putting the drill in reverse and unscrewing his hand from the board 
1886,now op  to show your dad that you are a worthy offspring how about you do the same and upload the video so reddit can witness how much of a bad ass you are 
1887,i believe the appropriate action would be to remove the bit from the drill and proceed to the er
1888,my brother did this when he was about 1820 working as a panel beater  drill slipped off car door and an inch into his arm they said he had nerves and shit wrapped around the drill  he did nt take it out until at the hospital  but no serious injury came of it this is the same guys that broke 13 bones over the course of age 1222  including but not limited to hit by a car on his bike breaking his tibia  fibula and femur in one leg  than breaking his knee 3 months later after he left hospital  breaking both arms motorbike riding and skateboarding  multiple times on different occasions  resulting in 2 2025 cm scars up both sides of one arm dude was seriously injury prone
1889,you re supposed to do that otherwise the drill would ve ripped all the flesh off if he had just pulled it out my dad told me that when he drilled a hole in his leg 
1890,  let s see righty tighty  lefty     oh my god    
1892,i read this in the voice of the advice mallard 
1893,no it does nt need to be said  you do nt have to break up just because someone makes one mistake  no one s perfect  and most people who say their significant other is nt ever a scumbag is probably a dirty liar  fucking reddit man 
1894, lawyer up  hit the gym  delete facebook   its the reddit way 
1895,i had a similar instance happen with a former roommate he did nt feel that he had to pay his share of utilities for 3 months because he stayed with his girlfriend most of the time  me   whether you re here or not you signed a lease this contract with your signature means you pay your share whether you stay here or not  him   well i do nt think it s fair because i m not here enough to use my share  me   that s not my choice or problem your belongings are not moldy  wet  or stolen they stay here in a heated  locked  house if you do nt pay your share your stuff wo nt be here to enjoy the free storage until you re using it as i really hope you try to test my word on this  check on the kitchen table the next day 
1896, well then i guess you do nt need the utilities going forward i ll just flip the breaker for your room and shut off the water 
1898,i have two room mates and do nt charge utilities its just one flat rate  and seems to be working out so far even when one or both of them run a window ac unit  i still come out ahead 
1899,let the council pay the council tax  i pay the homer tax
1900,you begin to think you are apart of a seinfeld episode when you have to argue with someone like this
1901,people are fucking cheap it s not hard that if you re on a lease  you pay equal shares of the lease and all utilities does nt matter if you re there  does nt matter if you do nt use the oven you live in the place  you pay your share of all common expenses done 
1902,if you are acting as a landlord to people who rent out rooms  as opposed to apartments or houses  you are certainly dealing with people with limited cash flow you should manage everything with this in mindat some point  some of the roommates will come up short and they will try to nickel and dime you and you ll still be on the hook for whatever they did nt pay because you ca nt get the powerwatercable shut off just because one roommate could nt pay  your place would be unrentable after you kicked them out  with this in mind you should never bill split between the tenants  your rent should be inclusive of all utilities and cable and internet everything should be in your name i would suggest totalling the annual cost and adding 25  and adding that to whatever you charge for rent the 25  premium will be a wash once you figure in people flaking out on you and failing to pay rent  its a better system  less conflict  no monthly bargaining sessions  and safer for you 
1903,tell her you ve never used a hair dryer  so she should pay it all 
1904,then i guess i ll charge twice in the winter months when you put the ac at full blast heat oh  and you will be charged the reparations in case it breaks because i told you 9000 times not to put it at max but you do nt listen
1905,one of my friends tried to pull similar shit to that the other flatmates promptly kicked him out  you live there  you share bills unless one person does something stupid like buy an ac  leave it on all day in their room and are the reason the powerbill is so high  then everyone pays the same amount 
1906,did you shower  brush your teeth  did you use any of the lights  charge your phone  charge your computer  use the internetwifi  is your room the proper temperature  that s how i would have handled it 
1907,i actually had to put a clause in the rental agreement i have about this so it would never again be an issue every time my old roommate would go out of town he d ask for a break on the rent i was so glad when he moved out 
1908,i m impressed that her hairdryer uses water and gas and internet 
1909,quarterth
1910,hah  i work for a cable provider in student apartments and have had students on multiple occasions tell me they are nt paying their bill because they did nt watch any tv that month long story short  they do nt have cable anymore 
1911,i m bald and never use a hairdryer do i get free electricity 
1912,http  ikinjaimgcomgawkermediaimageuploadsqf0jceshjl29uirzlspzy0ynuxujpg
1913,i ve had this happen and the worst part is their parents were paying their bills for them
1914,just integrate the utilities into the rent the tenant thinks they re getting a deal and you only have deal with collecting payment once 
1915,one quarterttthhh
1916,i will start her carpet on fire  for a reduced price 
1917,flat rate is the best answer here do nt split out utilities  just tell them to give you x amount a month 
1918,in most states  1 kilowatt hour is 10 cents last i checked  my hair dryer took 1500 watts or 15 kilwatts multiply that by 1 hour and bam i m paying 15 cents for every hour that i keep my hair dryer on watch out for those stoves and fridges guys 
1919, 14th  what the hell 
1920,it s important to make it very clear in writing that splitting utilities has absolutely nothing to do with usage it is considered part of the rent the average split in my home comes out to  50 per person per month in winter this can spike to  90  in fair weather months it s  25 when i first started renting rooms i gave room mates the option to split or pay a flat  100 more each per month flat rates have to be much higher to account for spikes and possible abuse 
1921,easy solution make the rent high enough to cover all your costs and  include  the electriccable in the rest that way they cant argue they did nt use something 
1922,itt  lots of people who think that water  gas  and electricity are entirely pay by usage  with no base fees 
1923,http  elvmemepzv5j7ljpg
1924,i have a real problem with 14th as a notation it s a quarter  14 a 4th might be accepted 
1925,i gave my brother a break by cutting  50 off his rent when he housesat for our parents last year he halfjokingly thought it should be more since it was nearly 14 of the month he wasnt there well  you left all your belongings in the roomhouse  so we ll just call the rest a storage fee i spent a week out of state on vacation  does nt mean i do nt pay the full mortgage amount 
1926,why do i feel like this one is familiar 
1927,i tried to get out of paying my share of the phone bill as i did nt need  want a land line they did nt agree and i ended up continuing to pay for it i think they cancelled the phone as they both eventually got cell phones as well  apparently 20002001 is exactly when mobile phones reached their tipping point 
1928,that s not how this works that s not how any of this works 
1929,you are renting to degenerates
1930,feeeeeeeeeemales
1931,had a potential flatmate ask if she would have to pay rent while she was away for 6 weeks annoying brown people in png as part of her church carry on yes yes you will no i am not interested in covering it as a form of donation to your church and your stupid mission to one on the the most hostile places on earth where you most likely will get killed by the rascals and i will have to sort out your personal things 
1932,i had an awful roommate a couple years ago who would try to get out of paying everything she d constantly be late on rent  would nt pay the internet bill  and claimed that since she turned off the heating vents and lights in her room she was exempt from paying the light and gas bill  so  i kept a record of everything via email correspondence where i d contact her about an upcoming payment  see the excuse  and saved it in a file i changed the wifi password and sent the file to the property management company who threatened to kick her out  it was a shared house with other people  and she finally capitulated mainly for the internet access people suck it s the way someone is brought up and whether or not their parents spoiled them and gave them a false sense of entitlement 
1935,i forgot about that show it was so good
1936,anybody else read that in his voice lol
1971,my roommate returned from a two week vacation and attempted to pay half rent and half utilities i said  next time you go out of town you should think about finding a sublet because that s not how this works 
1990,call us women 
1991,at least an american presidential candidate is acknowledging the existence of one of the two other countries on the continent 
1992,morning in america  i know the gop worships reagan  but that s pretty fucking blatant right there 
2058,he s saying  hey  canada looks nice  let s be more like canada  
2123,nail a 2x4 to a doorwaydone 
2125,do you live in a studio 
2128,return it
2146,i do nt see them getting a divorce honestly
2194,the woman who lives in the apartment under us blasts music at full volume  because  music is my medicine   she also sings along sometimes  and the fact that we can hear her tuneless screeching above coldplay s is an achievement she has to sing because jesus loves to hear her sing  and he healed her fibromyalgia because she sings to him  but at least she keeps it between 9am and 11pm the woman upstairs is very old and very senile  and she shrieks  help me   over and over again  sometimes at 3am she hates her nurse  so there s often the screams of  get outta here  get away from me  owwwwwwwwwwwww       these will be repeated over and over endlessly she also peppers it with  i m dying   but unfortunately that has nt been the case  we ca nt afford a house  
2195,putting an offer on my first home today 
2196,congrats i just bought my first house friday and moved in on saturday loving it need curtains though 
2197,unless you have a psychotic murdered in your house who s into music no one will hear you 
2202,i can not wait for this to be me  hopefully later this year 
2205,i just moved into my first home in the first week i managed to trip and throw a speaker through a window then the fixture in teh shower exploded and spew glass everywhere  yes  being a homeowner is the most amazing thing ever

2211,i just bought a house and this above all else is what i am looking forward to 
2213,bought a house 3 years ago and the first year or so  every time we had people over and started playing music i d get a bit panicked  i d stop and think  hmm i hope this is nt too loud and the neighbors complain   then i d realize i own a fucking house   and the only way the neighbors would hear the music is if they were in my house  woot    best feeling evah   
2214,i had a glorious surround sound setup that i put together with money i did nt have  worked at the big yellow tag store  but was in apartments for years when i first moved into my house i watched some blockbuster films and turned it to 11 one of the best feelings in the world 
2215,i m coming to about 8 months of being in my house now i find my favorite thing about it is the garage  i know some condo s  apartment complexes have garages but this is the first time i ve been able to keep my car in a garage during the winter my morning are so much better 
2217,as the proud owner of a mortgage and probably some of my house  i resemble this success kid home ownership is the best thing i ve ever done

2219,sometimes i leave the tv on in another room as if someone else live with me 
2220,got mine in may congrats  learn how to build stuff yet 
2221,this is the single greatest reason why apartments suck
2222,i m jealous we have a neighbor that lives below us that loves to blast music to the point where we can hear it in our entire apartment would nt be a huge issue  except they choose to do so at 67 am and late at night anywhere from 11 pm to 2 am during the week 
2224,the day i moved into my home  bought it nearly 8 years ago  the first thing i did was grab a hammer and i smashed this awful shelf the previous owners had built in the corner of the living room where i waned to put my tv tore a pretty decent hole in the drywall  but i did nt care  cause i could  that was a great feeling congrats on the house  enjoy it  you ll get really good a diy stuff now

2228,my time in appartments was some of the least enjoyable living i ve done people are    the worst     living near them is    the worst     i m a reasonably handy guy and maintaining a reasonably well built house is easy  buy a house maintain it yourself enjoy your life 
2229,this is what i do nt get about all the townhouses going up around me you get to pay 400k for the privilege of doing all the upkeep while still sharing walls 
2230,right   best feeling ever i ve been experiencing it since december i m still in the phase of sitting on the couch and looking around being thankful and amazed 
2231,congrats  enjoy mowing your lawn and fixing the shit that breaks every other fucking week and replacing your water heater twice in six mont  erm  sorry i m projecting enjoy your home 
2232,currently saving money for house  fucking hate apartments  my jealousy is there good on you 
2233,i could never live in a house again  i m way to comfortable the fridge breaks  call the landlord issues with heating  call the landlord there are a million examples like this  and the fact that i know that i m completely alone in a building freaks me out been living in a house before not my jam 
2234,is it all along the watchtower  because you might just be a cylon 
2235,congrats op  my wife and i just finalized our first house purchase  and i can not wait to leave our condo building next month have an upvote 
2236,a mans home is his castle
2237,sorry  i should have mentioned when i play loud music or movies  i keep it at the nonasshole levels loud enough to jam inside but not loud enough to hear a few feet from the house 
2423,be careful with those  apparently there is a wrong way to use them  mine fell off and ended up with 20 stitches  lol 
2424,he means molding and trim  its the stuff that mostly goes around the floors  ceiling  inside corners where the walls meet  and around door frames  i think he means the pullup bar has no where to rest because the doors are nt  trimmed  and that s where the plastic piece hooks onto so that it does nt fall  tl  dr the area around his doors are as smooth as the rest of the wall gg no trim also op  you could get something  like this   http  wwwamazoncomexpressworkoutcrownsportinggoodsdpb017kxjxn4ref  sr_1_20  s  exerciseandfitnessamp  ie  utf8amp  qid  1455632384amp  sr  120amp  keywords  pullupbardoorway   does not have to be this one  but if you want to do some home pullups  do nt use  no door frames  as an excuse buddy  get them gains 
2428,where do you keep your doors 
2429,yeah somewhere on rpettyrevenge  theres a pissed off guy gloating over how he only loaded enough paper for his own print job
2440,obamacare is precisely why expanding government is a bad thing the us government is fucking it s citizens up the ass and charging them for the luxury
2444,yay nhs  
2445,thankfully since i only make 12 to 15k a year i only pay 8  a month for a 3565  copay and 4100  deductible that gets me 2 well visits and 2 prescriptions a year thing is  i never go to the doctor and i do nt take any meds aside from ibuprofen for cramps and nydayquil in the rare instance i get a cold what i do have is a broken molar that is rotting and a need for glassesneither of which i have money or insurance for because vision and dental are nt covered under my basic plan and i ca nt afford to pay 100  extra a month for those two things  do nt get me wrong  i m well aware that i am much better off than millions of others i just find it so incredible that something which is so key to overall health  dental health  is not a  basic health care need  whereas two prescription medications are  that tells me that the state of this country s medical industry is whacked 
2450,the fine can be cheaper but it s based on your income also you re fined for each month when transitioning between providers 
2451,the cheapest i could find was 160 they gave  200 in credit each month so i used  100 so that i would nt owe a whole bunch i was hoping i d break even nope i owe  1200 
2452,single payer or nothing its that simple insurance companies are not there to help you they are there to help themselves the middle class is shrinking  the internet is destroying brick and mortar so why do they still think middlemen are worth it in this world
2453,so i have a legitimate question here i was doing my taxes and it asked me what months i had insurance  laid off oamp  g back in june 15  i did nt have insurance for the remainder of the year had i selected i had insurance that whole year rather than augdec  how would the irs know if i was lying or not 
2454,the commercials for it are like  mine is 65 dollars a month   the cheapest plan in my state was 212 i m not a smoker and have no preexisting conditions  
2455,i m right there with you  270month is the cheapest plan i can get the frustrating part is unless something huge happens  i ll just tell the dr i m uninsured so i can save money nice system 
2457,just pay the fineit s cheaper  fuck obamney care  and all the rubes who were grubered into shilling for it can go straight to hell  you ve been suckered by the establishment again 
2458,it s a law  i do nt have any how will they know and what will they do 
2459,i here ya just a three years ago i paid  450 for health coverage for my family  four daughters and wife   the company s health insurer declined our old coverage due to low employee numbers as we had layoffs now to get the same coverage it will cost me over  2000 affordable care act my ass  edit  this is per month not per year we are now splitting coverages between out two employers which still is  800 per month 
2460,meanwhile in the uk i fear that maybe we may have the same problem considering the state of the nhs 
2461,i do nt know about you guys  but i calculated it and when i pay the fine next year  it s still going to be less than what the cost of that shitty overpriced insurance is i have no choicemakes me so damn angry that i ca nt afford to get health insurance and the cheapest obamacare offers is  380 a month was nt the point of it to provide affordable health care to those who need it  fuck this system 
2466,glad i work where i work  around 450 a month and i have 1000 deductible and 2500 out of pocket max which the deductible counts towardsi broke my femur skiing 1 month agoalready hit out of pocket  time to test all the things   
2467,time to get on the exemption band wagon  next year  casually forget to pay a utility bill for a couple months  get a notice for shut off  then pay it off notice of disconnect for a utility exempts you from fines 
2469,obamacare is for the poor  except that i consider myself poor and i have trouble affording health insurance but hey  i m getting around 250 dollars in fines for not having health insurance for 2 months last year which is nice now i have less money due to health insurance  and less money to see a doctor  considering the insurance covers next to nothing  thanks obama
2471,it took me a while to even get my legally required health insurance because  apparently  the government did nt know i exist they could nt find anything about me in the damn system i have a driver s license  social security  i m registered to vote  i m registered for selective services  my fingerprints are on file with the coast guard for my merchant marine documents  how the fuck do you not have me on record  
2473,they made healthcare 10 x worse for middle class  even low low low middle  basically everyone with a job
2478,just another way to fuck the lower and middle class  pay more for something shittier  if you do nt pay you get taxedthis shit pisses me off so bad
2479,ctrlf canad still not a canadien in sight mentioning that is less than what i get taxed on my revenue for our universal healthcare and then i get an other amont for dental and other shit trough my workplace  the trick is to forget about how much you get taxed like that money was never yours to start with 
2481,blindly defending the aca is shameful please check jon gruber s comments also  where is anybody s  2500 per year savings for the average family  sorry guys but obama has been pretty bad for the middle class anybody have a modest savings account  used to give 5  or so in the last 7 years it s been 01   zero interest rates for an entire presidency  that s a first zirp meant to stimulate the economy has not worked or it would be over 
2482,my family had health insurance before obama care and now we pay much more private health insurance is great for my knee they charged 25k but insurance got them down to 18k when dealing with the goverment they probably bill 30k and it s paid not nearly as efficient and we all pay more 
2487, 140 a month with a  6700 deductible is the most  affordable  plan on the healthcaregov website how the fuck is that affordable 
2492,so my work insurance is like  18 a week before obama and it is now approaching  65 a week  but no we had to change the god damn thing and everything is fucked 
2507,thanks obama 
2512,i ve gone the past 3 years without insurance sure its risky  but its way cheaper to take the fine than to have insurance when i used turbotax i managed to avoid the fine the past two years by checking that it was unaffordable 
2522,trying to understand here how can you have a door without a door frame  serious
2524,the prevailing theory is that the prices will begin to drop once more and more people are signed up  thereby spreading the burden of basic cover costs over the masses or at least we are suppose to trust private corporations with a profit motive to drop prices once enough people sign up with their companyi guess i actually do nt know how it works 
2525,why would you wait  it s been out since saturday 
2526,just want to let you know that it can be used for dips and pushups with more wrist support so it s not useless 
2527,i would if i actually cared to hear any of his music i can not stand the guy 
2528,i d pirate it except then i would have to listen to it 
2529,i for one am happy these 2 weirdos found each other i hope they grow old together 
2530,this is supposedly for young people i m a college student who lost my insurance when my parents got divorced about a week ago luckily i got my taxes done before that but i went on healthcaregov to try to find the cheapest plan for me  250 a month because i make under  11000 a year i m ineligible for any kind of discount thanks obama 
2531,i have no interest in listening to it  but i ll gladly seed it 
2532,i think both their egos are so massive that they ll never get a divorce kanye thinks he actually is god  and kim thinks shes a queen  they re perfect for each other 
2533,the reason so many people have torrented it in the first place is because it s a tidal exclusive and tidal is nt that good 
2534,pretty sure kanye is nt 53 million in debt  just one of his business ventures  the fashion one  failed and that is what s 53 million in debt  not kanye himself 
2537,this album is complete and utter trash i used to like kanye  but his music sounds terrible now no redeeming qualities left 
2538,universal healthcare is a great thing it is not universal healthcare to make it illegal to not have healthcare  so that you just have to pay private businesses your money so that you obey the law wtf is that that is the problem with obama care 
2539,holy shit do nt listen to all of these people telling you to go buy plywood and have people cut it for you at the store any place that sells 2x4s will most like likely also sell 1x4s which are the same thing but half as thick  but only a small fraction as thick as people recommending plywood   it s perfect for this application somebody else mentioned a header above the door and behind the drywall and they are right there is framed wood on top of the drywall do you would nt even need anchors just drill pilot holes and use wood screws  edit  you can also take the time to finish the cut 1x4 if you cared to so it does nt look too ugly 
2540,can someone explain this whole fiasco  why is he so in debt i ve had midterms and have nt been keeping up
2541,it s the only way to listen to it on an ipod 
2542,then why is kim still married to him 
2543,what happened to physical copies  is this album even on cd  i just started a cd collection and it would suck if every new album will be released online only 
2544,that s debt he created  copying a digital file only does not give him profit 
2545,this is baby insanity wolf at best
2546,you obviously were nt gon na buy it in the first place soooooo so what 
2547,the paint is real
2548,wow so edgy you sure showed them 
2549,i know a guy that downloads every kanye album just to delete it 
2550,husband is covered affordably alone  but adding kid and i make premium increase 15x but because his insurance is affordable we do nt qualify for subsidized insurance under the aca and we do nt qualify for medicare so we re expected to pay over 35  of our income to premiums fucking insurance and government bastards working poor fml 
2551, really    https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  inariyfpmiy 
2552,so you signed up for a free tidal trial

2563,i ca nt wait to not buy  listen andor download his newest album fuck him
2564,this was one of the most original things i have seen on this sub in a while good job op golf clap 
2565,and then not listen to it
2566,i swear  he needs to get his congenital phimosis fixed it s affecting his decisionmaking skills 
2567,i do nt understand  i assume that he got a lot of money at some point  and then somehow spent a lot more than he had to end up in debt  how fucking stupid can you be  50 millon dollars is a lot of money but being 50 million in debt is just ridiculous
2568,why would you subject yourself to such torture 
2569,can we all do this please
2571,i probably would have bought it until he moved it to that tidal shit just gon na pirate it now 
2572,gah double scumbag  he does it again months later  losing another staff member 
2573,document  document  document have himher send some kinda email or text saying this first rule of asshole managers cyoa    c   over   y   our   o   wn   a   ss

2580,bring it to work we have one at work and it gets used frequently got ta keep the back and arms strong for the lunch time ping pong   
2581,maybe he should ask his useless in laws for some money
2583,congratz on your pushup stabalizer bar 
2584,i wish the whole celebrity culture would just fucking stop i do nt care about any of it the cardassians can die in a fire and the endless award shows can follow them 
2586,why did i read shitshow as shitposts 
2588,just so you all know  you do not have to pay the  fine   however  it will be taken out of your tax return if you are owed one constitutionally they can not force you to pay for anything  yet the can take it away from taxes you over payed say your taxes are prepared through the year and you pay like a 1099  if your return comes out to zero and you have no insurance  they can only  fine  you  but can not force a payment for it but if you lie on your tax forms and just say you have insurance  that is a felony punishable by law so  better hope ya do nt get audited if ya lie 
2589,why do you people even want this douche bag s music 
2593,aca is good at insurance  coverage   not actual healthcare itself coverage does nt equal care 
2596,ok 
2598,i ca nt leave boss  i ve been institutionalize

2627, deemed to friendly  more like  grown an attachment to 
2628,i would nt say i m uncomfortable  buying  condoms but selecting them is the tough part i do nt like standing around in front of other people trying to make up my mind about what penis cover to choose 
2629,overly friendly fox
2630,buy your condoms on amazon  there no problem 
2631,you re god damn right have an upvote
2632,god bless self checkouts 
2633,everyone is slightly embarrassed when buying condoms if they say they are nt  they re lying like peeing in the shower
2634,pudding was here 
2635,i have pop pop in the attic 
2636,not even fucking close to true 
2638,the only time i was ever embarassed was when i went into rite aid and for some reason it was packed with old ladies 
2639,this is where society has gotten us  we re ashamed of basic bodily functions  as far as condoms go  why would you be embarrassed about fucking  i ll wink at any old lady that sees me buying condoms  every time 
2640,i congratulate the man when i see him buying condoms there shouldnt be a reason for being ashamed its like  congrats on the possible sexy time and way to be smart by using protection 
2642,ring ding ding ding dingeringeding   
2643,or maybe i was nt raised in a sexpositive way and i was told by media  teachers  and society in general  that girls that have sex are in some way dirty and unworthy of love  with the exception of being within the confines of marriage but then you should be having babies so condoms are only for hussies with loose morals  i m a fairly well functioning  most mature  adult  but i will blush 9 kinds of red buying condoms 
2645,you are entitled to be as embarrassed as you d like but you still got ta buy them  it s when you re going to risk yourself or others with pregnancyinfections because you feel embarrassed that the problem occurs 
2646,it is nt embarrassing to buy tampons it is difficult there are like 300 different types it is like a whole freaking isle at the grocery store 
2647,he s what we call institutionalized 
2648,hard to play fallout when you re getting texts all the time 
2649,same goes for holding your so s purse while she tries on clothes or whatever be proud  are you ashamed of your so 
2666,if i m gon na play ranked i ca nt be responding every fucking 2 minutes  well i just laid down  gon na get some sleep babe 
2669,my heart breaks for you brother
2673,my wife did the same thing she was super excited to buy one she did she was instantly let down when she realized that it would not work with our sliding pocket doors 
2675,when my husband and i were just boyfriend and girlfriend and had just moved in together  he would pretend like he was about to go to bed at the same time as me by acting like he was taking care of a few things before bed i would just pass out expecting he would be in soon  but quickly figured out what was going on  we had a sweet talk about how it s safe to tell me when he wants some time to himselfafter i woke up one morning to find him passed out on the couch next to his bong and and empty pack of oreos 
2676,i ve got one of those  they re great    when i moved to my new apartment i found that it only fits in the kitchen doorway this is great though because now i just do a couple pullups whenever i walk into the kitchen 
2677,http  wwwamazoncomgpawdb00rjfrv1kref  mp_s_a_1_8  qid  1455651759amp  sr  88amp  pi  ac_sx236_sy340_fmwebp_ql65amp  keywords  pullupbar
2680,i  go to bed early  for this reason
2681,op i feel you my gf lives two hours away and we text allll day at like 11  00 at night i tell her its me time and that im not guna txt asap 
2683,do nt take it for granted be grateful she still has intense feelings for you 
2684,i did the same thing 
2685,i do the exact same thing and then play video games with my friend for like 4 hours 
2686,9pm   i m off to sleep babe goodnight honey  sweet dreams xoxo   12am  just one more episode of the walking dead  happens every night 
2687,i must have a weird relationship  but both my gf and myself have been known to text eachother  i do nt really feel like texting right now  i m gon na just relax a couple hours before bed   and then say goodnight then  its pretty awesome 
2688,every time my wife goes out of town i text her that i m going to bed early in reality i m eating mushrooms and i do nt want her to ruin my trip love you babe 
2689,pretty sure my girlfriend does this to me 
2690,i did that with my ex told her she was ok with it it s better than me just ignoring her for a while and saying i was busy i ll do it with the next one  and the one after that as well 
2691,all of my previous gf s have demanded i text goodnight and good morning with an accompanying  i love you   i really hate this it s so robotic and inauthentic to just mechanically send text messages because of my state of wakefulness it devalues the phrase  i love you  and just feels so phony to me  i m a pretty fiercely independent person and need my own space texting literally all day or i face hell is such a huge drag for me i d rather send 34 texts a day that are real and emotive  and if we really have nothing funny  poignant  or substantive to text to one another all day it s really not the end of the world to just not text for a day just holding boring conversations over text all day brings down everything else about the relationship for me  plus  it s really nice to have something to catch up on when you see eachother again  when you re getting playbyplay updates of her day at work  her conversation with her mother  or her experience grocery shopping  then by the time you re together in person you ve exhausted possible conversation topics  tl  dr i m probably guilty of this 
2692,wait until you move in together 
2693,and then she sees that you started playing hunie pop via steam 
2694,i think a lot of us have been there i love my girlfriend dearly but i  as most guys  can suffice with a couple text exchanges a day whereas  she prefers to communicate throughout the day and top it off with a call at night now i travel for work  gone monthurs  for 3 months a year so i see where she is coming from  but personally i miss her but do nt need to constantly be in contact 
2695,and then there are some of us who do nt get texts from anyone  do nt take what you have for granted 
2696,i tell my husband my phone needs to be charged he will text me alllllllllll day long   i have shit to do he ca nt hold a conversation with me but he sure as hell can text me stupid random crap allllllllllll day long no joke  i will walk out of my house and take 30 steps to my barn and my husband will have already texted me 2 times he watches me leave the house and starts texting it s driving me insane and yes i have told him he does nt get it i do nt even respond anymore and he will still text i only text important things 
2697,my girlfriend and i have been dating for almost 2 years and we just recently found out that both of us do this exact thing but just browse our respected internet vice
2698,ive been there  slowly ignoring her more and more as time goes by then she leaves you and you are just filled with regret
2699,i know that feeling before texting it was phones had to end the call just to get off the goddamn phone sheesh 
2701,at least she wants to talk to you 
2703,omg all of you in this thread just need to be open and communicate with your significant other if you do nt like to be texted incessantly  tell them that  as someone who has been a girlfriend before  we know you pull this trick sometimes we do too 
2704,i m in a long distance relationship and was doing this  and had done it in previous relationships   we ve decided to really cut back on texting and try to skype or at least call for at least twenty minutes a day i ve got ta say  i ve never felt better about my relationship with my partner it s freeing to be able to live your life and then to actually care what they re sayinghave something to say when you talk to them rather than getting minute to minute updates and then wondering why you have nothing to talk about
2705,babe imma hit the hay ttyl  but its noon  i said goodnight
2706,i do this to everyone except my boyfriend i just like some peace and quiet once in a while he s alright though 
2707,it s what every guy does in that situation used to be in a long distance relationship and i would do the same thing 
2708,it s en lieu   and you also used it incorrectly 
2709,get some gymnastics rings  pullup bar on steroids 
2710,the fact that people have to do anything like this is pretty telling of the day and age we live in i m not sorry to say that if i do nt feel like responding  i wo nt  unless it s something important and timesensitive  obviously i m not an  asshole    i do nt think it s at all ridiculous to be expected to let people have time to themselves i value my alone time a great deal because it s how i recharge  and sometimes i just do nt feel like texting why people feel the need to be upset  as if they ve undergone some terrible injustice when their so does nt respond right now  we ve spent the entire duration of human history up until about 10 years ago having to accept some level of patience with communication  and now it s as if people are fucking  villains  when they do nt get back to you the moment they see you ve reached out  fucking god  it s a technological nightmare i refuse to accept the utter annihilation of my privacy and personal needs in order to meet some ridiculous  irrational social demand for  always being on   fuck that i m going to sit in my lavenderbubblebath d tub  smoke a fat blunt  eat some goddamn nachos and listen to lana del rey and no one is going to interrupt those two hours of personal glory except the cat the cat can come in 
2711,i bought one when i was in my old townhouse only to realize all of my doors were too close to a wall on one side 
2712,you could always awkwardly work out with the apartment door open so your neighbors can see how weird you are 
2713,i did the all the time with my wife texting is a waist of time if we are nt doing something together i have better shit to do with my time 
2715,what s a cd 
2716,it does nt matter in my case i have absolutely no intention of listening to anything that complete moron has to say 
2717,wtf is a cd 
2718,i m pretty sure neither of those things use cds digital audio files probably  but there i go being a pedant again  wake me up when they make a site that lets you stream vinyl  s
2720,but you ca nt even get it on tidal
2721,or  you know  just do nt because fuck kanye and his bs 
2722,you know it s coming because she wo nt be going broke anytime soon 
2723,yea but he says he is nic cagelevel broke 
2724,she wo nt divorce him until he gets out of debt 
2729,i used to be pretty messy had to clean up my livingstyle a bit after i moved in with a guy who is worse than me  he leaves everything on the floor when he s done with it clothes  plates  halfeaten food i clean because i do nt want to live with roaches fortunately i found that i really enjoy cleaning  he claims to be a neatfreak i think he actually believes it  too 
2730,or not even bother to listen 
2731,it s kanye west  i would nt even waste my 1 s and 0 s to torrent it 
2735,do nt think he cares it was suspected that he leaked yeezus a few days early before its release 
2772,i honestly could nt give less of a shit  regardless 
2774,grow up
2775,as much as i claim to ignore reality tv and vapid celebrity gossip  but  i m
2778,your post is the second time i ve seen the word vapid used today about 10 minutes ago when i saw it i thought to myself have nt seen that word in a long time then here you go delivering it again makes me wonder if i usually ignore it or if you saw it too 
2779,i can see an indecent proposal reboot here starring kim  kanye and mark zuckerberg 
2782,have you honestly seen either of them talk about each other  they seem perfectly  legitimately  happily married  and love each other and their children  to ask for that big a misfortune on people that have done nothing wrong aside from  saying  questionable shit  and more importantly  you will never meetinteract with  is horribly dickish  and i m flummoxed how 2300 people can upvote such a heinous thing 
2783,why would you even say that
2784,i hope she got a prenup  since he s apparently  53 million in debt 
2788,i take it you are single 
2798,op  just out of curiosity  how old are you 
2934,aww it s cute when people do nt understand how the real world works 
3163,be careful what you wish for  in my experience  the ladies really do nt care for bushy  wiry beards 
4193,valentines day 2011 i was buying condoms and some chocolate when i looked beside me at the line for the next register and a lady was buying 5 boxes of condoms and 2 boxes of chocolates she was either partying with a few friends or having one helluva session with her so 
21479,as opposed to the nonidiots looking for advice on reddit with a short onesided story and no context 
23131,it s not embarassing 
70599,just got back into reddit after a 3 years i ca nt remember what frog s purpose is 
73617,cmon reddit  let s get op to the front page   
75763,wait  what  are women time travellers or something 
75764,pro tip  break up with someone instead of cheating  stop wasting the other person s time  just move on from them if you re in a relationship that s so bad that you want to stray outside of it
75765,flawless logic of a cheat 
75766,she stole the idea from your suspicions and should pay royalties 
75767,some women are just straight up crazy a few years back in college i was hooking up with a married woman  i know  i should nt have  and wo nt again   while she was fun in the bed  she was a literal insane person she would complain to me about how her husband does nt trust her and thinks shes cheating on him  and she d say it in that  how dare here even think it  tone as she says this i m confused beyond belief  we just had sex less than 5min ago  had be been hooking up for almost a year  and she acting like he s the jerk for even thinking she would do such a thing she would seriously say stuff like that all the time  it was so crazy i did nt even know how to respond to that  this sadly really turned me off the idea of marriage in my life not only would she complain about her husband not trusting her  even though she totally gave him plenty reason not to trust her   but she would talk about how her and her friends would talk with each other about their  boy toys   these are all uppermiddle class suburban women  and all of them were cheating on their husbands so casually they all talked about to each other like it was just a normal thing growing up  i just did nt realize cheating could be this common 
75768,men cheat because men are assholes  women cheat because men are assholes ancient slut proverb
75769,math and keeping your legs closed are very difficult
75770,did you marry my ex wife 
75775,i m having a really hard time understanding the logic on this one 
75776,i would come home late from work and the ex wife would always demand i while out my pecker and she would sniff it to see if i was cheating on her she would try and smell for soap or pussy juice  i was working 15 hour days  1488 an hour just to keep the rent going and pay bills while she worked her  7 an hour job filing paper work  after we split  i found she was the one cheating with the neighbor and a few others and they would all wash their junk in my bathroom sink made sense on why she was always asking to smell it looking for soap 
75777,some people just have to blame others for their issues i m sorry she s one of those 
75778,you ca nt fix stupid
75779,same thing happened to me i had accused her of cheating  which she had been for the 9 months of the 12 months we lived together   she said she cheated because i did nt trust her enough ya do nt say    noped the fuck out of that one 
75780,lpt  if you masturbate and still want to cheat you should break up with your so  basically if it s anything more than physical release you seek in someone else other than your so you should end it 
75830,my ex fiancee pulled the same its my fault she cheated 
75908,i got almost that exact line of reasoning from a girl i had been dating for several months she did nt have a car and i typically drove her to her parents house from her apartment just off campus when her parents could nt do it one evening she tells me this guy is coming to pick her up at like midnight to take her back home  i got upset by this  she then cheated on me with him and said it was my fault because i  put the idea of cheating  in her head 
75909,so because you accused her of cheating a year ago  she went back in time an extra year and started cheating just to spite you 
75910,damn op  that s a tough one my exwife hit me with this line once  well at least i never cheated on you  until i cheated on you  somehow that made it better that my suspicions in the past were incorrect  even if she did eventually validate my feelings
